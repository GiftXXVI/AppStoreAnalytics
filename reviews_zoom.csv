VERY POOR WE HAVE TO STUDY IN SCHOLL WITH THIS APP BAN IT ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
This is not downloading
i am opening the video but it is not showing in the participents plz as soon as posible solve this problem
It is very bad app because I am start this app so it are many ad
Very poor quality ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
I've been using this app for nearly three months for online lectures and recently it had so many connectivity problems. At the beginning it was all good but finally it didn't even let me to connect to the meeting because of which I missed few of my classes. I figured that it was all because of the recent updates that the links were not working and once I got the new update it worked. But at least you could have given a notice for the users about recent updates so that I wouldn't have missed so many lectures.
"My phone screen rotation is off, still screen rotates in meeting. I don't like this feature. Plz either remove it or give a option to enable or disable this feature..."

Keeps cutting off. Error 5
I am a student who just switched over my account to the SSO option as it was required. I have a picture on the account from before it was switched. The school didn't inform me that I would not be allowed to take it down. They now have my picture. I have emailed zoom about the issue and nothing has been done. They own my account but not my picture. I have contacted the SSO and their excuse was that everyone's was like that. I am so mad that my SSO took away the freedom of changing it..ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡

"There is very much problem of network and cleartity of video,video is much blur due to network"
You can give virtual background option
Super app one one time becoming waste app
It made our online classes startðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡
Facing lot of issues with aug and sept update. Audio issue and disconnected frequently.
I am tired of online class
The worst app ever made and why the hell did I gave it 1 star it doesn't even deserve it many. It has problems like screen frozen in middle of meeting even if u are on pc. Disconnecting frequently and some times I can't even join a meeting it shows (error code 5) WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN and if that is not enough this app has a lot of problems. But there is one feature that is good the virtual background but it is still not spotted in some androids. That is all please improve the app ok
Worst app ever

Very bad app.The smooth surfing is not present.
I am doing Online Class From Zoom ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
If I do multi tasking then my microphone get automatically umuted. Fix this issue.
Very bad experience taki somuch charging please work on this !
It was a better app till the last update. From when the last update is there it is behaving very badly. Its now getting worst. Even when the camera is on it is showing that it's off. I would like that this should be fixed as soon as possible. So that we could use it properly. If it is done like the previous version then it would be best. If this issue is solved then I think many people will like the app and the feedbacks will be positive. Please solve this issue.
Zoom is become very bad due to update if we go to chat our camera will off And also in phone we can't put background
Would

Since the lockdown period I started using the zoom app for taking the class. But after july I faced a lots of connectivity issues here. Many times I got disconnected automatically durning the class. Sometimes I can't even join the meeting. Sound quality is very bad. Students are complaining that voice is cracking... And video quality is getting worse day by day. Sometimes I also missed the class for this problem. Please look at this matter sincerely.
It was good at first but after the last update it is creating problems
Mera Quarantine Session barwad kar diya tuuu...

What is happening. After the latest update i cant enter class. It shows connecting after i entered the password. And then it says could not connect to service. Plz fix this problem. The teachers are marking me absent. And also this october 5th my exams are starting and they only send the exam like through zoom chatbox. Please fix the problem as fast as possible

Thik
Waste app don't have video clarity
please tell me how to add virtual background in Android
"Up to today, it was great. I use it for church small groups during the pandemic. Today, my front (selfie) camera was nearly black, but the rear (main) camera appeared normal. Restarting Zoom and the phone, and creating a new meeting had no effect. My regular camera app sees from both front and rear equally bright as normal. I found a reddit thread saying it's only Pixel (original/XL/2/2XL) phones with Android 11 that are having this issue, and Zoom's tech support ignores free users."
I am not able to connect... I report this problem but I didnt got any feedback... It shows connecting... But I am not able to connect... Pls do something related joining... It's really luck by chance app... If our luck then it will work or else not...

Its hard making a account
Not good.
Can't change my background
You need to log in all the time u use the app
"This latest update, September 29,2020, is Terrible! Every freckle is exaggerated to the point I look like I have smallpox. If I could retrograde I would. If our organization used any other video conferencing applications I would jump shipping a heartbeat!"
App will not update..
pls fix the audio
I hate zoom! I can't ever get join a meeting because every time I try to enter the ID number it doesnt work. This time it won't allow me to enter the last number of the ID after entering it 10 times!
"On computer, OK-ish. On phone, very hard to use, no sound, not clear where to click to unmute, not easy to get the landscape view right. I have used TEAMs, Google Hangout, Skype, all of them are better than Zoom."
nah not good peace
"Log in, join meeting. ""Meeting requires log in"". Log in again (despite already being logged in) join meeting. ""Meeting requires log in"""

I don't want to do school on zoom
La app mÃ¡s invasiva de todo el mundo en cuanto a privacidad se refiere.

Doesn't work with bluetooth devices
I hate this app
I hate . ****
"Zoom used to be amazing. I've used them since at least 2014. Back then, they had great customer service and a quality product. While the app works fine, the quality is greatly deminished when porn shows up during your professional meeting. In other words, their security is still not where it should be, and it takes months for them to respond to issues."
"Service promises 24 hr long mtgs, multiple hosting devices. It's all a fat lie. Declines mtgs over 40 mins, won't let me use my PAID acct on phone. theives"
When i hv updated my zoom app.. I cant share picture neither video.. From my phone.. Its irritating me alot.. In vivo.. Phn it is disturbing alot.. Plz help me ouf of this.
"Out of all the facetime apps that we could have chosen, we chose the worst one possible! Zoom laggs everyday and it's just a complete waste of my time. Especially the new update! Please fix it!!!"
I have been trying to use it but everytime I put in the passcode it says its wrong every single time I have a meeting. Google meets is way better and a lot easier.

Zoom was working fine previously but after the latest update I am unable to use the share screen option.

"I would have rated 5 for this app. Unfortunately, I am giving 1 because, whenever I try to start screen share, it does not work at all. The drop down menu does not appear. I am unable to screen share. I have tried in all the possible to fix it. I am unable to. I older versions of zoom were damn easy, comfortable,and use to work properly without any lags. The new updates of August and September are the worst.If the developers fix this problem,I'll give a 5 star and recomend all the people to use."

"My video screen changed on my android the other day. Now my video looks like a funny mirror you see in a circus. AND ITS FULL SCREEN! This probably wouldn't be so bad, except I have meetings every week and I cannot figure out how to fix the problem, or, why my screen changed in the first place."
Nice app But too many addsðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
"Nice app for meeting but student can paly the instagram , whatsapp, and pubg back ground...."

Virtual background support for Android not supported for Vivo Y series device. Disappointed much. :'(
It's disgusting to see that virtual background option is not available for Android devices even though Androids have far superior front camera than IOS devices. My device is powered by 32-megapixel Sony IMS sensor front camera ðŸ“¸ but still virtual background option is not available on my device. I will appreciate your and your team's work if you enable that option for Android devices as soon as possible.
Bad..
Rate
2 is better than 1
Audio volume is low.
Nice
Head ache
Wow
Internet connecting issues idont enter my class
I give this app 2 stars because when i start it up my phone screen is black and going back to homescreen please fix this issue to use this app properly thx
Please don't rotate screen if the auto rotate of the device is turned off. I'm having very much of trouble. At least put a option to change the settings.
It's a very good app for classes during the pandemic COVID -19. But it is doing some problems in the video option my exams will start a few weeks later that time I would have to turn on my video but I cant because when I turn it on it shows that it is on to me but my teachers keep on saying me that my video is of and for the exam I have to turn it on so please fix it.ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™
Nice
"Worst,many problems are there,if you install it,please do not update this app."
Terrible ui. Terrible stability of the app.
January
What type of app is it ?? Even my video is on in participants list it's showing off I was scolded many times by my teacher Please correct this bug
I like this app but sometimes it couldn't work that's why i am giving 2 star and there is one more problem that i could not upload profile from gallery
NO sound on either desktop computer or android phone I spent 1/2 hoirs tearing my hair out EVERYONE ELSE were ok so i just had to be a bystander
"I have to give 5 starts, but unfortunately I have given 2 starts only because whenever we join a meeting or any thing we are kept in waiting room this is wrong we should not kept in waiting room we should directly join meeting while other aaps directly join meeting thankyouðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜"
ðŸ‘Ž
The reason I gave it two stars is that when ever we were attending meetings any person makes ID and enters the meeting and disturb whole class even play music. And due to it our meetings were cancelled before timing and this app was cancelled for meetings and Google meet was taken up
I am not able to change my dp on the zoom clouds meeting.
Not much better

"My camera has changed inside the meeting platform. Months ago when I first heard about this, I could be in lower light and I was not dark. Now , no matter what light im in, I'm dark and silhouetted."
"This app works reasonably well, but for teaching, I need to share my screen , and unfortunately in this state, I cannot see chat messages in the notification bar. This is the main reason I prefer to teach with another app..."
Masy T
Junk
"I hate the limitations of zoom on a computer, they are much more distracting on a phone. It's time to go back to living a real life"
This app is really helpful but after I updated it it has a bug My video is visible in the galary preview but not in the participants list Please fix this issue ! It's still not resolved yet ðŸ™
Not able to change the background in android even after updating the app thrice.
This app is are problem when you are in a meeting it will leave the meeting and come back when the meeting is done
I cant even share my screen while hosting my meeting please resolve the issue..
Rubbish
Please do the correction actually whenever I use to open the video then it does not show my video in participants list..after the it's latest version
So I really didn't go on it but if your a teacher you should get this. But it said that I couldn't download it and I don't think you should get it if pretty bad
Nice app
Aab ye app thoda teek se chalte hai join to kari hi deta hai tab bhi bekar app hai
Update Verson so bad
A bit hard to learn at first. It should have a tutorial for first time users
When my video is on its showing off in the participants list after the last update
The quality of video is absolutely horrible and sometimes the audio. The app glitches alot but other than that the app is useful for reaching people in different places and people are able to connect and have classes through this app
My video never work's and sound cut's off during my meeting.
There was no problem in zoom but from the recent update if my camera is on in zoom then it is not showing on in participants list. So please fix it fast!!
Good
Why this app is getting worst with updates . Whenever update comes it have new problem I think the developers started taking 'ganza ' after august 17 2020 meanwhile fix it
"Very unclear audio and video. And, very complicated functions."
It's great but it losses data alot like one day my daughter was learning through zoom classes and before the classes had even started my mobile data wad already gone so if u don't have wifi and u r using mobile data and u r ready to use 500 mega bites(MBs) everyday then it's okay
Supper
Good in use some time it is not working but it option are very easy i like this app and it is more important when i am taking my online classes
It is very useful app i like this app

It is good but i faced lot of connectivity problem
Good but need to improve a lot i always got exit from my class room . Showing that an unknown error occurred after the updation also... that's is the only problem.i hope u guys will fix it soon
Very bad
Video and audio is not good
It used to be a most wonderful app until few days ago when I discovered I find it difficult to hear participants when sharing my screen and participants say my voice is breaking and freezing I reset my Samsung A6 tablet to factory settings twice but the problem persisted I think zoom has a general audio hitch that needs to be fixed immediately in order to maintain their number one position among rival apps
Login problemðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
"This app is good only i have been using this past 5 months... I have updated this app recently...there is a bell button in chat box if we press that it says ""you will not see any chat notifications in the meeting"" after pressing MUTE also the messages will come and my video is on only but it is not displayed in participants. So please fix the bug"
There is a big problem of voice break in its new version i can not listen clearly on whole lecture my studies are spoiling
This app is very helpful for online classes but the latest version of this app is disgusting the voice of candidates are not at all clear the camera is on but still this shows that my camera is off
Not working
I don't know what happened but the app is broken. I try to join a meeting and it tells me to register when I'm logged in already
This app has waiting room but this Can't be disabled when I updated the last time there our teachers faced a big issue because of this
"Need one option through which I can connect my DSLR as a webcam in my android zoom app for the webinar. This option I have seen in camerafilive app. So I though if this option would be inside zoom android and iOS app, that makes it too attractive."
It want more improvment they are so much lag some time we can't sign in or login
"Worst app ever destroyed my whole qurantine,still cant delete this app for educational purposes"
Hopefully we can see the attachment via chat in mobile app.
"Need one option for android app that is when i am going live in webiner, then i can connect my dslr with android through zoom app like camerafilive app has the feature. That will be very much attractive for us."
The app has Battery Draining.
No good and not bad

"I am using zoom for the last few months and it was awesome before these new updates, it was the month of june i have placed my phone 20 meters away from myself and my microphone was working excellent, but now i had to go closer to my phone to speak. I think this is a bug and sometimes when I click on more, the emoji will sometimes disappear"

No virtual background
This app does not works proper. It wants many updates. The meeting quality is very low
Virtual background is not working even I reinstalled the application so many times and team is also not responding to me....... Completely disappointing....
"The latest updates are worst , if my video is on then also it's showing in participants list off kindly sort out this problem.. Btw app is good"
Please zoom team ; when ever I join meeting it is connected but when I turn on my video it's turned on when I see myself in the scrol but it comes then I go to participants it tells your video is off please fix zoom. Zoom is becoming better too please fix this big please.
. . . .
Not having stable connection
Good
"Before updating the app it wasn't having any issues but now when I on my camera in the participants window its showing off and also the speaker quality is very low , I request the developers to please look into this problem."
"But I can't sign in or sign up in it. When I do it, it shows you are not eligible to sign in right now. So what should I do?"
so much drain Battery in Mobile.
your new update doesn't show my camera on in participants window even though it's on. And your app takes a lot data pack if their are 3-4 meetings per day it takes almost 1 GB internet. You should make it internet less taker.
Its showing that the video is off in the participants by the way it's a nice app but it has many problems
Oh my god I'm getting irritated by this app after updating even though I on the video it's showing of in participants. Please fix it
This app is very nice but kindly do the back ground boud in the next update this is my request kindly do this
Can't able to share the screen
Hate it
It shows connecting when i start a meeting And does not allow me to enter in the meeting for hours
Chin app india delete this app for India
The Zoom app is very worse after its latest update... My video gets automatically off whenever I switch tabs.... I hope these manufacturers may change this in the next update Best Of Luck Regards Abishek N
I am not getting the option of Vrictual background
App full hanged my thus is not good app to use
The updated version is not good as because while using it in android and doing this earlier video used to pause and now the video gets stopped and that's why the host feels he or she is not interested if a phone call comes during meeting the video gets stopped and the reasons are mentioned why I disliked the new version earlier was very good....
nim mane kayvoga ninnada nange holiday ne beda ansbitideðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–
I can't download it :''((( I need to attend my class huhuhu :''((
"It is becoming more unusable!!!! When on a zoom call it still allows your mobile phone to ring over the top of the zoom call. The best is if you are on a zoom call and another zoon call comes in, forget about! The app is so stupid it doesn't know your on a call and it rings anyways. LOUDER THAN HELL!!!! Now I'm deaf. Forget hitting ignore call, that just rings again, and again and again. Forget the hang up and answer buttons are reversed from the desktop. How misguided is development?"
Amazing Zoom it is very useful to me and all
I really dont like this app but it only for school if no school i fell give 0 star
Sound quality is low when meeting is joined via this app as compared to when meeting is joined from laptop or PC
mint version i have not so hot.
Se corta a cada rato
Not simple to use
Is it really that badðŸ˜­

This is a good app because it has good options of audio and video but Audio is very bad in this appðŸ˜¡. I am unable to listen properly that what teacher is saying.
Good for meeting
The app was very good but since i made an update I can't even sign in to the app and its really frustrating.
Good app
Voice not comes clear . It always disconnect automatically
Overall great app but buttery drain is terrible during the call
"Ita realy laging and freezes everyones video most of the time,cant be used smoothly,it also consumes lots of data."
There should be an option to delete the message we have sent by mistake
Zoom in nice but updating it this time creating some problems in camera.When we go in participant option or chat option the video will get off and it is irritating.So I kindly request you that please change the settings of the zoom and make it like before.And also it is creating problem in screen sharing . When I didn't share screen it will show stop share and when I will share it shows start share so please work on it also and try solve this problem quickly as much as possible within 4to5 days
maganda sana to kaso wala akong load baka naman

Dont install this app my device
The last update is worst update. Ihave been using it since April. I'm a student. When I join the meeting the video is switched on but when I Try to give answer to question through chat or when iopen participants the video is showing off. Due to that the host is thinking we aren't listening to class and removing us from the Meeting.
Need option to set video quality manually.
Nothing is good
Old version was better
"I am a student and I have been using zoom since the start of this pandemic. Today I tried going on my class zoom call like always and was met with a ""To join please register"" so of course I registered and updated the app. Now Its not letting me join my classes at all. Whenever I try joining again it tells me ""Finish Registration"". When I click on the button it just takes me to the home of zoom and that's it no steps no nothing just blank."
Why is saying video is off but video is on and its say that video is of in participant
Not bad
You need a computer degree to work zoom. Total waste of time.
On trial being a first user.
"Hi all I wanted to share my experience with zoom with you all.... It's a good app....but the only thing is that a lot of problems occur while a meeting is hosted or I host a meeting...for instance I was not able to unmute, not able to leave, Keeps on turning off my video...so on I hope that it functions properly on the future without any discrepancy.... Thank you Have a nice day :)"
It is excellent app i never sene before but at some times it is not working properly if the network is good also the video is not properly coming it is bad at that time at another time it is excellent . They have to develop this app a little more it is a good app

Why getting problem while sharing during the meeting... Unable to get share option... Why? No one is looking into my issue
Nothing much
Thik hai..
I am unable to share screen from very last update. Make sure it will get repair soon. I am using this app from April and it shows good result and easy to use but from last update i cant screen share to teach.
"videonya ga bisa di pause. biasanya kalo saya pencet home (tengah) itu videonya bisa ke pause. tapi sekarang GA BISA! videonya mati. tolong di buat seperti itu lagi. saya tidak suka versi terbarunya. dan juga katanya bisa pake virtual background di andro, TAPI KOK GA BISA? tolong ya. selama masi begini saya kasi bintang 2 aja. makasih"
Please Fix this bug : After this update (I am in mobile)When I Go to participatents/chatbox/Mettings settings my video automatically turns off. It is very important to fix please fix it so that I can give 5 star rating.
I can't get the school notes which will be posted by teachers and I can't unmute myself when the option is given
The latest version is causing problems regarding video where students video is on but teacher cannot see it in participants list... This is way more problematic to explain teachers..
Nice improve more on stickers pls keep as emoji box in whatsapp as many
Some external sounds are hearing Suddenly/unexpectedly call ends
MAHA GHATIYA APP HAI MERA VIDEO ABB STUCK BHI NAHI KAR PATA
Video is always breaking

Average all over
Bad experience with me.....
"This is ridiculous...after my recent update When I have on my camera,it shows it off in participants. I am a student and this is bothering me so much Please help"
Very dirty
My video seemms too much grainy while joining...could you please fix this issue??
It was showing very good performance at first bit now when I updated in august it was having very bad performance no audio clarity more use of battery and data but now these have been fixed but with another bug when we are taking anything like chat or another app our video will automatically be turned off and on when we return this is not needed at all. So I am asking zoom to fix this bug but don't make another problem like what is said earlier. If this is fixed I will give zoom a 5 star rating.
OK and more features
Nice app..ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
When I sign up the zoom I verify the email but it resend my email
Previously when i was using this app in android while checking participant list or minimizing the app in background the video was getting stuck but now after update the video gets off. This is troubling me a lot. So plzz i am requeting to fix this issue as soon as posible.

"Im having alot of issues of voice, in the middle of the meeting i can't here the other guy, and you can only hear their voices in breaks, please solve this"
"Was brilliant when I first began using it, even though it was on my older Galaxy Tab. Now it just freezes when I have the sound on or something. Why fix something that wasn't broke?"
Nice app for studyðŸ˜šðŸ˜š
Please do anything when my child is doing class her face is coming broad not proper I want her face come proper by yesterday 09:00 am. Please

It is continuously reloading
Consistent in bugs . Stops after few days regularly. Have to uninstall and install again and again.
UI is not good
Ok
voice is not clear
"Glitch, bug minnor"
The app is not able to recognise my microphone even though my microphone are connected it do not show connectivity and the sound comes from speaker of the phone I have been facing this problem for over a month
Because if this app I can't sleep ðŸ˜‚ during my on9 clases.
Kenapa gak ada.suaranya?
Mm
"I m using this app since april,2020 my experience is very good but after this update I m facing many problem in it .my video is on but others say that it is off."
Work ability was impaired when it was applied. Could be as a result of poor network.
"Not so good, I can't even download this app, they keep on saying send feedback to see and fix, but still helpless"
Your making mobile users suffer because you turn off cams when ever a mobile users exits the app and uses another app which is required for quizzes and activities this new updates sucks on my opinion
"It was well.But after some updates the conditions are worse....when I switch on my video and switch to different app it gets turned off.The same thing happens in the chatbox too.Please fix this problem,students who are doing classes are facing much problem.Kindly bring the update as soon as possible"
There was a bug where other people say my camera is off but I see my video. I am so confused and this only happened on the newest version for android.
"I've used Zoom in all its different formats, PC, ios and android. Both mobile apps have some limited functionality which I understand but I wish the android app had at least the same functionality as the ios app. It's very frustrating."
I couldn't find original sound in zoom setting on this phone when getting together with other pianists. The audio was horrible quality.
Too much battery drainage Its fine for video calls but not good for phone specially battery
I've told you many times about zoom s lacking meeting work flow functionalities are going to be available in the upcoming MS Teams update. A stand alone zoom meeting is useless because there're other aspects of a meeting eg. Documents mgmt etc. Are missing badly in zoom meeting. I'll be using MS Teams for sure for my upstart training portal. Your CEO doesn't have a good grasp of the market needs period. You guys ignored my feedback and now you're going to pay for your arrogance. Tough luck!
If I sign in and attend the meeting in iPad within 1 hour I am not able to open the app itself and my school wants me to update the profile and it is only possible if I sign..what the hell is happening. Many iPad users are also coming up with the same complaint
sound not clear at all
Good
I hate this app why beacause sign in inka meeeting code
When I pin a person the video is freezing no moment when I double click it's just views like clicking a pic and shows that
Poor audio quality
One year experience.
"After the last update, im unable to see the share popup when im clicking on the icon. Please fix it."
Unable to hear voice Disappointed
"I'm using this app since April and was very much satisfied. But after new update on 21 September, I'm facing a major problem that this app automatically turns off the video camera when using in background. Please fix it in next update. It's humble request to you zoom team."
I like this app and their is also many functions is this app â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜â˜ºðŸ˜â˜ºðŸ˜â˜ºâ˜ºðŸ˜â˜ºðŸ˜â˜ºðŸ˜

Good
Nice
Super app ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜šðŸ˜™
This app takes a lot of time to update...
Unable to disable waiting room option. Fix this issue as soon as possible. As it is very inconvenient to admit each participant in the meeting. Earlier this option is working well.
It is a good metting platform but it lags a lot
Nono o
Even though my network is working well every time the session gets disconnects and rejoins the session its completely frustrating my organisation is using it as a common platform for interaction due to which i have to use it otherwise i would haive never used it.
Lot of distracted
It's good but by my mistake it uninstall and then second time it was not

Whenever I try to start a meeting it tells me host has ended the meeting?
Many bugs are there to fix
Nice app
It uses a lot of battery and net but it is a good app.
"Zoom is good app but the new updated version is making video problems , that is stopping when we go in chat or participants option and it is big problem when we students are writing something or giving messages using chat option to teacher's. I kindly request you that please make the zoom like before ...... Please give attention towards my problem I think that you may change the zoom and try to make zoom like before and please try to make quickly as much as possible means within 2 to 3 daysðŸ™ðŸ™"
Should allow to record the meeting
Getting 104114 error while accessing
"Zoom is getting better, still not great for phones. When using the front facing camera the video is super dark. Don't give me lighting tips, light is good, it works in every other app just not zoom. I have to have a bright light inches from my face for the zoom app to pick up any light at all. If I switch to rear camera, no problem. It's just zoom and just the front camera. Also my resolution is 16:9 but I can only broadcast in 4:3? I wish BlueJeans was the industry standard. SMH."

"I am the host, but can neither use my personal account when i start meeting nor I can't join the meeting as it say the meeting has been ended by the host! If these issues are resolved u'll deserve 5 stars rating!"
So bad in sign in
Battery consumption is very high and after updating the zoom meeting is disconnected itself and it takes much time to rejoin.
Overall App is good but I can not see hand which is raised by other participants. Please solve this issue. Thank you.
Its a good app but sometimes it just doesn't open my meeting or it just shows failed meeting or it vl get declined the meeting automatically....
Well
Atharv
New update was not good
I want to tell that every time when ever I on my video in the participant list it is showing that my video is off I am download in his like a hundred times and still there is no change ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°how can i attend my classes

Not good
Many issues
It is not signing in
"The app file is too heavy. Can't we have a Zoom Lite version. That way I can have many more relevant apps too on my device. And zoom consumes more data compared to Google Meet or Microsoft Teams. I use it because it's most popular for trainings and meetings, maybe it's the industry pioneer. But please look into compacting the app size."

"Android app works good on Note 8. Android app is being dropped on Chrome OS. Chrome Extension has not worked well since April on Samsung Chromebook plus. I guess I am not to use Zoom on Chromebook? I love Zoom, please listen and then fix."
Good + Bad Why Good: Easy to use! Why Bad: Limited Only so that you can BUY for full feature for a very EXPENSIVE.
Not satisfied. The mobile phone in which I am using zoom does not give sound input nor output though there is a strong WiFi connectivity. ðŸ™
My vedio was on but it was showing off.pls look into this matter.thank u otherwise it is good.

Nice
Nice ....
I can't connect to my class because some errors are coming daily
Nic
I am using this app 4 to 5 months but last 2 to 3 days my video is not working properly and its looks blur in screen
It is good app but usability features are bit less. * History of last calls should be configurable * when a phone call comes it doesn't give caller a busy tone AND it mutes the zoom call. It shd continue on zoom and only mute when person choose to accept phone call. * Screen wake up options and background color to be provided in setting
Google duo best
Not clear picture & not secure
"Initially the experience was good, but since past two days it is not working properly. The camera being on shows that its off in the participants section and to every participant. The video of a person keeps getting on and off by itself, though that person has kept it on only. That's a huge bug. Please fix it."
Good
Remove photo option is not available. Unable to remove it once it is set
It is good for learning but after when I update it and clicking on participants my video was turning off so please solve this problem
Good application
Can't download this app
Zoom app irrates anyone network problem report problem
"Since I updated the app, I've had issues connecting to the meetings"
The problem is when i open my video i can see myself but the others cant see me.plz fix this.

I even have a good network connection
I have to watch connecting screen more than class This app has a big connectivity problem
Nice

It is not a good app for a important meeting
I was just previously updated the app and next day when I was joined the meeting I was able to hear others but my voice was not reach to other people....... This problem is not ignorable........ It has better video quality but please try to improve video and audio quality too .... ðŸ™„ðŸ˜Š

Zoom update please . And add extra and more features and make zoom amazing app. Please also add without sign up or sign in profile photo feature. In chat plz provide the Google key board . And permit the sticker and gif features . Please make a zoom smooth app .
Before when we go back on other window or go to participants then our video was use to pause but now when we go then on any of them our video is being off? Resolve this problem!

Before the update came the zoom was fine and ok. then now its so laggy and i cant even tell what my teacher saids when my teacher unmuted me i dont know what to say because the audio was so annoying it always stop i cant even understand a word sometimes the wifi was fine when i reinstall it again the zoom is back to normall when it goes back again sometimes i uninstall it and install every time i just wasted my data for the zoom so many times i just rated 2 stars because there i a big problem.
-Virtual Background support for Android Meeting features This feature is not available just installed and was looking for it. Cannot find ðŸ˜« it.
Hi zoom maker there is no option of vertical background in new update
De video is not in its quality form even if u update it
It won't let me sign in or sign up. I have had to mad 8 different accounts and it keeps cutting me of.
My front facing camera isn't working properly anymore. Something stopped working in the app. I can no longer use it as it is too dark! The app is no longer usable. Fix this ASAP please.
"I've lost money on research because, they could not hear me.. If they hear me the problem will be they cannot see me. Im using mobicel 4u phone."
"This recent update has really screwed with my phone's audio and video. My normal camera works fine, but when I enter a meeting, it looks like I'm a black silhouette in a super dark room. And I used to be able to listen to a video and the call in the same audio source, but now, it's one or the other, I don't know if it's because of the android 11 update."
This app is trash
My Android smartphone keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. I can use my Landline o.k.
Okay okay
Galaxy Buds Plus not supported. Bluetooth speakers are also not supported. Whenever I am using my galaxy Buds nobody is able to listen.
"It's kept on directing me to adds every second, the sound kept on freezing of the host."
Voice and video quality is not good
Not clear voice of other side I can't hear the voice of host
Very good
Very bad
Even after installing the 5.3.5 version in zoom app settings it's showing version 5.3.0
ðŸ¤”
"I feel like this update hasn't done much..in fact, in some cases it's done worse. Now when using the app its awfully laggy, and when someone's speaking it breaks up like crazy.This isnt much of a problem for some, but I'm kind of upset that you basically cant change your pfp."
ðŸ‘
"Okk , but there are lot of issues"
Poor Audio and video quality
Very nice quality of zoom aap I like it very much.
Bad app ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜­
The app updates have made it worse. You can view only the half screen of the host during a meeting and the basic plan has been reduced to 39 minutes now. The once good picture quality has now gone bad. The app developers dont even reply for the complaints of customers. slowly it is reduced to 37 mins. Outrageous.
Its worst aap ever
Good work
There is no filterðŸ˜‘
Zoom group Please reply... aftervthe new update during a meeting when i open participants or chat my video goes off automatically... i don't no why... please fix that bug.. earlier the video was just stuck now it switches off completely... please fix it...
Nice
For android can't change background.
Good but not working properly ðŸ™„ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜³ðŸ˜¢. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS PROPERLY. OK .
Lately I am unable to join meetings using WiFi but when I change to mobile data it connects immediately. But this costs me extra money. This app was good until April. But day by day it is getting worse. I want to ask developers if they can fix the bug where we can join meetings using WiFi too.
âœ–ï¸âœ–ï¸âœ–ï¸âœ–ï¸âœ–ï¸âœ–ï¸ dirty app
"It is very Bad experience, When I open my Video Camera it showing camera is Off what a rubbish updates!"

The update sucks. Like srsly??!!! Turn off the front camera if they leave the app? Thats the stupidest thing ever!!!! Why the hell will they even include that feature?ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
"This is.. We can't say worst..But this app needs improvement... My first meeting was very clear, the audio and video both, the network was working smoothly as it always does.. But my second meeting, that was worst. My teacher told me that all the students have to join the meeting at 11a.m. But when I connected with teacher, it took 14 minutes to connect..And my teacher scolded me coz I joined the meeting late..Problem is the network connection.. Not in ur home, but in this app.. Please fix this."

It voice quality is very bad
Earlier it was working good but after update it's been not able to connect
App is very good but virtual background is not working. Option for virtual background is not coming even after update on September 21 2020
Worst!!! Automatically leaving meetings
This is good but this not downloading in my phone
"Don't know what' problem is going on in my zoom account ,i can' t listen to any one clearly,speech just breakdown,im suffering this problem for few weeks."
I really haven't used it that much â˜ºï¸
"Very good in meetings, and awful in direct calls! When calling someone directly there are so many defects: - No ringing to the recipient If app is not opened for long - No notification to other parties when call interrupted or busy - If I'm the one who call directly why do I need to ACCEPT again entering the call.. Unneeded step. - If two persons calling each other at the same time no busy notification or at least merge them into the call.. Someone has to end and re-call"
It's good...but it could be better if zoom had aloud audio recording
Super

App is not downloading i am trying from last 20 min very slow app
"Most of the time this meeting it functioned well, but a few times in my 3 hour meeting all sound was lost. I could not use my microphone for the entire meeting because others could not understand my warbling. I use Zoom fairly frequently, and this was the worst experience with it. We only had a group of 12 members meeting."
Good but not better
Very helpful
not a user friendly app
I can't hear anything
There's no option visible for enabling virtual background in Android App.
Good
Always problem of audio
App is good but one thing I don't like about this app is that android phone users can't use the virtual background thing. I hope in the next update they will take this into consideration.
I would give it a 2.9
Stop changing the zoom meetings settings
Very complicated not sure the what the difference between this and FaceTime
Itsssssssssssssssssssssss Ok
"It is ok. But when we are host and need to share screen, we are unable to see the participants on Android."

"I don't know why but I don't have ""switch camera"" button in my app"

Very bad app. Only one person can speak at a time. If more than one person goes to speak then it becomes problem.
Cannot hear meeting! Too much static!!!
Instructions are not user friendly. Do not know how to access various features such as break out rooms. Cannot get any audio.
NYC app
I dislaike online classes This has caused hamper in students ming
App is good but as a user ..this is my suggestion ..there is no safety .. somehow if anyone know password they can join meetings without log in their id and real name ...which is such a big issue u should update this settings that the hosts can see their email id or maybe phone no ...
The app is not working on wifi that's the weak point and rest working is nice. It is to be updated many a times and if not then the app doesn't works
Not bad
Few point to be considered:- 1)The app should allow the participants to change their display name by joining through link. We students have to copy paste the full meeting I'd and password in order to join the call by our roll numbers. 2)There should be a hide button during the call to hide or lock the interface as most of the time we end up turning on our mic or video. 3)The app doesn't follow rotation settings of the phone. 4)Unable to join meeting error 5003 despite strong connection.
I dont like this app it has many advantages like calls and meeting for class and therefore it has many disadvantages like some time teacher allow me to unmute my self but i cannot unmute myself and also it video call graphics are so low may you read my review and solve this problem.. Ok thanksðŸ˜ƒ
The app is excellent but the placing of accounts is very tight and time consuming.
I am unable to join meeting these days. Please help asap.
The app is very bad â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸ðŸ˜ž
Audio quality is not good. And I want the virtual baground for android phone please do this.
Very bad the speeches are lacing all the time network is good but very problematic app
Kk
There was bug that in meeting when you return to home screen and then to meeting screen it turn black
Frequent disconnection
It consumes battery alot. And makes phone heat as if its cooked in the fire ðŸ™‚But its good anyway

Good app but more usage of network so i dont like the usage of network but good for 'online class'. but audio trebbul i request the Zoom app to be offline zoom app it will be useful to us.
"This was working fine before the update only used to lag sometimes and meeting used to go back, but after the update I am not even able of join meeting now, and this total loss for me as I am missing my daily lectures"

à¤¥à¥‹à¤¡à¤¾ à¤•à¤®

Good app
Hey I am not able to sign in why?ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ 
The viedo is pa
Really good app . But i gave only 2 stars because it just makes my face look soo strange . I DON'T know why . Some beauty camera is on . It just wont close ..
Its very badly voice quality.......
Good but if there is less network very bad.
This aap is good but sometimes it seems to be very poor.
Bad
It is not opening zoom
So much joining problem.
"I have only three problems with zoom (connecting to the meeting, sometimes the voice is not coming and sometimes voice is not coming clearly."
Best app
Pagal sa app
Worst app Microsoft teams is better then this
This was a wrost app in the world
It's easy to use but a lot of technical issues and glitches use lots of internet. While connecting to a meeting it mostly shows report problem
It is a good app but the problem is that it has atime lime for meeting please correct it
Not really nice but ok actually it heats up phone very quickly.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Audio issue...please update...not able to hear
It has too much connectivity problem
I do not like zoom Beacause zoom could sign zoom
The sound quality is not good and the voices are not audible
Good application
One of the dump app I have seen when I join a meeting the screen get blurred even though I have 1mbs internet speed the audio quality is also not up to the mark
Its helpful
Not to good
Too many problems .
The app seems to be rated for 3+ but it doesnt seem to allow age below 18..... middle schoolers also have online classes these days!!! And also only upto 4 people's face can be seen on the screen please do an update on your screen.....
This is a good app but the reason which made me give 2 star is I am not able to change my profile picture to none I want an update fixing this problem and the other suggestion is if there was a virtual reality even in mobile then it will good and you could have made seeing more than four screens at a time
"Ok so this app is good but not the best. The audio quality is not good. Sometimes it says ""host has another meeting in progress"". So i didn't even get to know that whether zoom is not letting me in my own class. If it is another meeting i will go. No worries. But please, stop this. This really annoying. I get really worried that I did join the class, but zoom didn't let me in. Otherwise the app is good."
It is the waste app I saw there is a trouble with audio
It is very nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ app but the problem is in my settings profile photo option is not coming ðŸ˜­ but why
"Bahut hi ghatiya app hai guys, 1/2ghante mein 200 mb net kha jata hai."
Very good..
"Before last update, this app was very good.But after update, I can't connect to the meeting.Please fix the problem"
"It went smoothly before I re-installed. Now the audio is terrible, I can't hear the conversation clearly."
TerrificðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤’ðŸŒ‹ video quality
Good
Should keep seen or un seen while charting
"Audio and video quality are terrible, like from 2004. Features are lacking. Why do people use this?"
Bad app

After updating zoom apps in meeting i cannot hear any sound why?
So bad aap use 2days phir vahi report problem .update nhi bhi mangata he tab bhi month 10day's mera class chhut jata hh so bad app not good working condition I'm use 1month this app works good very good but uske Bad aisa hone laga
Good app . But consumes more data . The screen becomes blur during the meeting
Swing kiosk media just x cuz call cause can call Xbox live gold digger prank call you when I got to go country and for the first place in Singapore
Need to be optimized for Android tablet.
Doesn't let me sign up
Unable to hear other participants.....my internet is excellent.....I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it's the same result.... please fix this
Add more than 4 screens on main screen
The app refused the sign up of my son because he is so young. Then when any adult try to sign up using the same device it refuses any one to sign up. The solution to this problem is to uninstall the app and reinstall it again....!! It should refuse the sign up for only the under age person.
It's so bad app my network is there than also this is not working properly ðŸ˜” I have installed this app for studies but I can't communicate properly with my teacher .
"Hello Zoom.us, Zoom was a good platform for online classes as well as from work from home.But as the days passed the problems arose day to day,I get disconnected from the meeting without any reason,even with stable internet connection of about 50 to 60 mbps,I've talked to many others and also with my relatives and my friends and the most (99.99% of them)are facing the same issue which I'm facing.Now I'm forced to write to you requesting you to look into this matter."
"There is literally no reason to use this over discord. Discord can do every zoom can but more and better. The only reason why this app is doing well is because of covid and schools don't ""trust"" kids with discord. Zoom doesnt have all the options I want and need. Discord is even more secure than zoom. It's ridiculous how this is the alternative for school and work OVER discord."
Poor
Worst app i have ever used it shows always error while connecting
it is vry good 4 online study bt. from 13-14 sept. it is not working properly. Altough video is clear and screen is visible but very poor audio quality is there. i cant understood what host or others r speaking. plzz improve it
///MS a.dl
Initially good now worst
It keeps laging and glithing most of th times i cant hear my teacher
Okay nice app it can improve the sound and video quality
My app is not working properly there is a good network in my area but then also it shows me the bad network and the screen is also too much blur please fix my problem. I am using my app in Redmi mobile.
Poor audio
It crashes at least 5 times and i have 7 lessons it eats my whole battery its not useful unless your phone is very powerful
It friend only 3 people it 40 min cloee. Not good 40 min over
Not so good~~~
This app is relly helpful for online classes and school I really appreciate this app ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ðŸ‘
I can't share the zoom link in WhatsApp and I can't sign in
"Hello team, can anyone help me with this app? I have given all required permission for app to work correctly but unable to hear.. Even my voice is also not audible to second party! What to do? I have updated app and checked. Also, I uninstalled and reinstalled. Still facing the same problem."
No betar exp8riana
Greebo ke lea shi nhi he
Azra beghu ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Glitch sound and blurred video. The screen isn't clear
Very bad
This app is good but zoom support I requested u to launch touch up my apparance on Android!
Thik nhi hai
"Too complex for the casual user. Setting up is also complex. Expects you to have a good knowledge of the apps operation from the start. If you only want to do social video calls, stick to WhatsApp"
Its a good app but consumes a lot of battery while other online app works till 4 - 4.5 hours when its full charged and in zoom meet while whole 100% battery is charged then too its low in only 2 hours and sometimes it automatic phone switches off Pls do something
After the recent update it automatically stops while running.If you solve this problem then you may expect 5 stars from me.
"It's good , but it gives problem and again and again and again we have uninstall and again install it"
"I think the app has extreme potential and has of course, helped us all during the pandemic and I'm grateful for that. However, there are a few issues that I wish were fixed for the mobile version of this application. For example, the tilt of screens which doesn't adhere to the rotation lock of the phone, everyone in the meeting gets to know whether your audio is connected or not, the chat & participants interface on the mobile is not as good as the web version. Wishing zoom the best of luck."
It was brilliant in the starting. But now its annoying. It was working fluently but now I am disconnecting several times in every meeting . Don't think it a network problem as other applications are working normally then why in this application the problem is coming. I disconnect so many times that I can say that this application is in HAZARDOUS condition.
Nice
It goes well at first tym all...but now recently I am facing some prblm lyk i cannot hear anything what other's are saying..its blurring so I couldnt catch up what they are talking about..i am damn sure it's not because of network problems...other apps are workng damn good..so not network problem...it really make problem in my online clss..
Good
Hello! I've been facing problem in connecting classes since 2 months.despite good network it does not connect. Please see if it can be fixed.
Alot of problem while trying to update the app
Waste
Their should be a setting that if host will not allow the participants they can't leave the meeting
I was using for the online classes .
I will give only two stars because it will not give proper responce and it will not sign up only we should give another date of birth
Not nice
Excellent

"I like the zoom app But it makes battery over heat solve problem please. Okay thanks,."
This app is very good to use but some time it doesn't work
This application is not much good as compared to others...but can do better ðŸ˜€
So good
Ok good
"The app is working quite good, but sometimes I can not minimize it. If I minimize it then I automatically get disconnected from the meeting. Please solve this problem."
No experience
I have seen many time that my meeting is not connected I don't know why from my side the the ranges is full but may be due to server problem computer say to report a problem
Please update new version of zoom ver old version and give limited use of using net of zoom
"At first when I downloaded it,it was fine but after some time, the video button started creating problems with me . The option was not there often.And hangs a lot. Fed up with this app"
After updating this app is not good
Can't turn off auto rotate.. Annoying af
Works when it wants to and cuts you off..
Voice is breaking
unable to connect
Same problen for me too
Some difficulties and issues are there please check the volume system while using there is no proper sound and voice not be clear.....
I have no idea why I can't join the meeting rooms anymore. When I joined a meeting and typed the god damn correct password it keeps freaking shows me that I'm typing a incorrect password. Marks gonna get deducted if I don't get into the meeting room
It is bad it dos not let me make a zoom meeting
Navigation is terrible
I am not getting on to zoom meetings
Good
OMG ! You have to be a IT engineer to figure this out. Im pretty tech savvy but this is crazy. I have an important meeting I was asked to attend on Zoom in Nov. I tried it on my laptop as well...even worse. Very unintiitive and confusing. I see devs dont respond. Poor support.
The video works well but the audio through the app is terrible. I have to use a separate phone every time
Not a good as in person meetings.
"Not great, should improve a lot"
Just not reliable
I can't join audio using my Android phone..
Not safe
Pls add virtual background to app for Android and tab users pls pls
App is good....but please add more filtres like snapchat and instagram.. And stuckers also... We have to look beautiful when answer the question. Thank you
Meh
Sometimes sound quality is very poor
Voice problem
Sound is not clear
With the latest update i started to experience sound problems. Participants canoot hear me and i have verified that the mic is ok. My device has low ram but previously worked fine
The audio will be not clear some time s
Thank you for launching this
"Frequent gaps and delays in audio and video transmission, esp. when more than one microphone is active (which is the entire purpose of a videoconference tool...), making communication extremely frustrating, to the point of incoherency. The Zoom app functioned fine up until the beginning of August. Since then, video transmission and esp. audio quality have gotten worse with each ensuing update."
Every time I'm on a class the audio keeps timing out continuously and that makes me miss important information that my teacher says this happens all the time even when my wifi is working really well.
Good

I don't change my account photo. There is no options for change photo
Good
Not enough of voice & video clarity

The previous version was ok but the new version just sucks
"I can't hear sound of another person,l would left and add again but problem is going on , error code 5 , fix my problem"
Video quality is best I've found. Joining and creating calls is needlessly difficult and time consuming. Speaker-microphone feedback detection and cancelation is far worse than competition. Aka expect heaps of echoing and poor audio quality unless everyone is using headphones. Options are extremely restrictive compared to pc version... Can't even select which microphone to use.
Stops and show errors
Good
Ok but not clear
We want virtual background in Android mobile also not in only laptop. If you do this I can rate 5 out of 5. In zoom next update please we want virtual background in Android mobile also
Is not safe at all. But at least the meetings are relatively decent.
We cant zoom the screen and this app needs high broadband connection and mobile data will over fastly
When others open other app over zoom picture is blinked or stuck Consuming so much charging
I don't know how to keep the background of anyone knows pls tell me please
"App is best ,but NET is complting in 3 hours 2 gb"
Network problem
Infact the app is good. There must be more features available to the users. Overall app is good not the best I would suggests to add some extra features like subtitles and recording facilities to all without the permission of host.than u

"Error code 5 is the most biggest drawback of this app I feel zoom should update its app whenever I I join using zoom in my school classroom I used to find the problem in joining it . It occupies less network than other App which force me to give 2 star. This app is better another stream also like- audio connectivity, screen sharing etc. as other things are better but I want that zoom team should work on error code 5 my connectivity is good"
How can we find phone number when someone miscommuicate to others .Only name shows in the meeting.If you hae any solution please provide me

Much problem to connect meeting
Last one was nice but after updating this it make my phone hot very quickly .
Sir your app takes much net consumption. It hangs in my phone(A10 android version 9) . It disconnects me from the class after every 2-3 minutes and I have a good wifi connection (vfibre) I get a speed of 70-100 mbps speed . It takes a lot of battery . Btw app is good
It is bad in clearity .zoom can improve clearity.
I always get out of the meeting even my network is stable then also They need to improve this app
Audio is very very poor
This app was very helpful and good
Dude where the video emojis I need them or for sing up only
It take too much of internet
Improve sound quality
I can't connect to online classes because internet is there but zoom is saying no internet connection and zoom is not blocked saying plz solve that problem
Connection problem forever
Network problem
Need development
In my laptop meeting is not launching I click the link (not launching) then I try with password then also not launching

The sound is choppy I can't understand can you please make the sound nice we are having a COMMUNAL PRAYER AND WORSHIP. I already log out 3 times then back still the same. Before it was nice sound but now choppy. Thank you.

Im so confused ugh
I think it is good but no everytime there are serval problem 1. It doesn't have feature to report that audio is cut or video is cut 2 . When meeting is cut then it allow admin to get that person 3 audio was not good it is echo
"Zoom aap not working properly in Samsung M01, videos and audio is breaking.. zoom need developing lite virson also,very worsted application for Samsung phone"
Nice and I will get back to you abouyyffjkhff
You have to be a certain age to create a zoom meeting
"These is good for all jobs,education k liya"
Glitching the entire meeting.
Poor
It is good but after i updated the app i cannot hear what others are saying when i switch on my video or or my microphine is unmuted pls solve this problem or else there will be a hard time.. see even after soo many people complaining there is no respond .. its very disappointing
Slow
Not well to use
"It is okay, but these are the main flaws 1. Poor connection. 2. My account has been deleted, and I am struggling to create a new one. 3. Very sensitive."
Good but not best ðŸ˜œ
Poty
Nice app for online meeting/ class
This app is great on PC and my son uses it for his classes. But on mobile for the first 10 seconds of connecting to a meeting everything is okay. Then after 10 seconds nothing is audible and everyone's video freezes and starts again and the same process continues until I am put in waiting room and rejoined. Still it works for only 10 seconds. Seriously please fix this. Zoom has a lot of potential but it just does not work properly on mobile anymore.
Not good app difficult to attend meeting
It's not good jio meet is better
Gel 0p
People limit now just 100 members only so increasing limit is better for increasing rating.
See its a nice app but there are certain issues where we are not able to listen when our camera is turned on and when its turned off it gets fine with the hearing thing.
Can't even use it after the update.... Randomly Crashes and sometimes causes my phone to restart I mean why on earth.... I can play heavy games for hours.... but 1 class will kill my phone or what ?
Can't connect Bluetooth devices in new version plz solve the problem plz
It's very nice app...
i cannot hear at all i can see and chat but i cannot hear them at all in my Dell Chromebook so i missed alot of what's what and that in their explanations so have to rely my friends to explain it to me to what the hell are they saying in zoom
This app is extremely difficult to use on mobile phones and asked me to sign in again and again to join a meeting only to end up not being able to join.
Good app ad a friend op when in meeting so ican met those people again
Network problem plays the main role and it takes more data than any other applications
Improve the zoom app
"when i firstly instaled it it was ok but now that i updated it ,it takes too long to connect to my meetings and the audio is not quite good every now and again it keeps getting worse"
Worst app
More upgrades required for chatting and other things
if only you don't discriminate android users. GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND FEATURE TOO!!!!!! ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢
Not good. My reason are the same
This app is very good but charging will complete fastly
Good
Good app
Wish I had more time at my basic plan
Voice breaks even if you have a strong internet connection.
It takes a lot of battery and a lot of network issue in this app
Sometimes it's not opening otherwise it's good
"Very good at the beginning but now, it is difficult to describe how bad it is. Especially the audio output very horrible, people that listen to me complain alot. Pls fixed it."
this app is good but not perfect having many issues related to profile pic change and time out of meetingg etc ......
Lot of bugs
Please stop the rotation of the screen when screen rotation is off
Why there is always a unknown person in meeting from where they are entering...is they are bots....
Good App ðŸ‘Œ
This app need to much internet.
The app is nice and worst too
Not impressed
Good
I don't like it at all. I am having very bad expirience with it because it can't connect to meeting and when it connects it again exits the meeting automatically then it says the network problem !
Now I can't install the app.I don't know why
Bad experience
Only 100 people can join the meeting and some people are not able to join due to this short limit
One if worst app.ever I come.I have uninstalled jus now.Thanks.
Nice app more networks issues and screen blur Plzz solve this problem but app is better
Good but sometimes shows some errorðŸ’ðŸ’ i dont recommend you to use it
This is worst aap ever
It is a nice app. It troubles and we can't sign in
It is very difficult to join the meeting and pls check it too .
I am reporting an issue with the app that I have been having for a while . I am using the Android Go version. The audio of the meeting is having grains while the person is speaking even though I have a good internet connection and a working speaker . I connected the device to a bluetooth speaker and I had the same issue . I want you to look in this matter as soon as possible . And I am expecting good results.
I got network issue it's not been connecting what to do
Good aap but connecting problem is very bad6

"The app is useful , but I like to mention some of the defects. Today when studying online class some of the Indian came in our class and talked unnecessary and wrote rough word. They have hacked and came into our class. It not just happened once , but it happened thrice times. Also the zoom meeting is not secure. I would request to the company who made this app, please tight the security of this app. There should be highly security system in this types of app. Overall I really like this app."

Can't see all participants on the one screen. Only had 12 and could view only 4 per screen. I have Android. Also when I called in no one could tell me how to see more on 1 screen.
It is useful but no clarity even the signals are good it's totally blur sometimes so unanle to see classes properly
"I have used zoom app from Windows version as well as Mac version , but when I used this Android version , oh my god there , was a hell of a lag even though my mobile phone was a flagship one and the refinement was good at Windows and Mac versions , so if zoom you are seeing this then I request you to please fix all the bugs that I get while scrolling in the meeting and please give all the features that are even available on the pc and Mac versions. Please zoom I request you to fix all of them"

It's not allowing me to login to the app ðŸ˜© Why does this happen
"Not very easy to use if you are elderly. The controls are not easy to find, so finding the camera and video buttons takes up a lot of the meeting time. They should be on by default and you should have the choice to turn them off if you choose."
Good
Voice breaking

I can't get the audio to work on my display when used in samsung dex. The audio just come out of my phone instead. Can we have audio output to our display even without microphone?
Good
I give this three stars because of well it's really hard to like make the meetings and like do it on your own so I think it's really hard to do that why I don't give it five stars and why I love it a little bit is because well if another person is like starting the meeting you can go on there and if you have to like learn or something it's really complicated but although it is a very annoying sometimes it can be also very fun.
This app is best but sometime host is cut the meeting and then another person is host so please some action from these problem
Ok App
No audio
App is nice and it help a lot in lockdown period but i faced problem with chat box. Chat box should be on screen by which i can easily give ans to my teacher

It is really helpful and easy to navigate through which is why I like it.
This app is good but the quality of the video is not do good
Good
"Good for meetings, great features, but video/audio quality can be improved"
I wish there was an option to see more than 4 people on the screen especially when using bigger phones and tablets.
"Its best app for together mitting , but is a worse problem is if network connection gets slow then voice level of mitting get down."

"I would give it 3 stars because if the host will remove us, We can't join again to the meeting. Apart from that zoom is perfect for video conference. Make sure that would be solved in the next update."
Mm
Hemmm
I'm only having one issue of audio because all the meetings are dependent on the audio and only that is not proper always the sound being irritated because the voice is dubbing soooooooo much. Please fix this problem
App closes again and again.
Nice app
Nice app so far
Super
I have no problem
It's Good
It's ok
Voice and video breaking up
This app is working good but my video is not off but in tha participants list it shows the video is off and the host are removing me from the meeting pls set the prob allright
Very helpful app. But has some problems. Every single time when I try to turn off the speaker in my android phone the app crashes. I hope you will fix this. And also I would like to have one more feature also. When I unmute you must ask me 'Are you sure you want to unmute?'. Because I accidentally unmute during meetings. Likewise video also. And I can't remove my profile picture. I can only change it. I think that you will add a feature of removing profile picture also. It will be helpful.
So far so good
How to use custom background in android zoom application?
Complicated to use.
It is all clear and it's easy to use and the virtual background is amazing option it clears all the background which is like disturbing it distractive. It's only less for something...try improving it's going to be a success.
Internet issues...
"There Should be an option ""Mai nai Bolunga"" in the immediate right of Raise âœ‹ and The app should support Mirzapur Sticker packs too ðŸ”¥."
I request you to add feature which shows that participant left the meeting or disconnected from the meeting

"I give it three ðŸŒŸ, i would have given it five ðŸŒŸ but because of consuming a lot of MBs for just 20minutes u can use more than 300+ bundles. Otherwise it's a good app"

"Very well... I use this app every day, except Sunday. But, there is a little problem if i use phone."
Vedio on kar ne ke baad bhi participants mein on nahi dekh ta do some thing

"There is a problem to join meeting,"
Your website is crashing and zoom is automatically taking a picture as a profile picture and to delete it we have to go on website and your website is crashing it's garbage.
This app is not so good
Nice
I it is a very real &good app
This is the best app for us I got 100 rupees super chat
Please add the feature of pinning the screen from participants screen by tapping on name
Lilawti kamble..ðŸ˜ðŸ˜˜
"Initially it was SPECTACULAR for clarity, but the upgrade that occurred about 6 weeks ago was horrible. I had been zooming with my tablet, but can't use it anymore due to garbled voices. It sounds like a foreign language & not Understandable"
Best app
"It is kind of good.But everytime I have classes,the first class eats up like 500 megabytes,so I am on a kuota budget here pal,you can't expect me to use 500 megabytes for a 38 minute zoom meeting,hope you can fix this issue"
Please make it down My School leactu res are on it
"I should give them 5 stars but I am giving only 3 because first when your network is good still the video and voice are not coming properly and second when I want to do the screen share it gives too many steps to do like sign in zoom ,sign in drive, etc"
Very glitchy. Log outs the entire thing sometimes even with good wifi.
Its video shouod hv improved
adarsh
Bad audio
Consuming too much data and fon gets heated.
A good messanger like Skype... how cool.
"Zoom, while a great feature that helps us communicate in these strange times on paper, seriously needs to be refined. You already know what I mean."
Best
"After updating the app there is a bug, when video is on but still showing off in participants. fix that Bug"
Loading so slow while update
"Screen sharing not possible in this new updates, kindly resolve this issue at the earliest please, creating inconvenience for online studies"
"Good app,,"
It's fine l guess
It is very good but after the new update...... . Things haven't been going so good. When one is chatting it used to hang and therefore the host wouldn't see a difference but these days it stops the video. Very annoying
I don't know why people use this over discord honestly. I signed up for zoom but afterwards I couldn't join a meeting and even if I signed out it still told me to finish registration and I couldn't even do that now I'm having trouble getting into school meetings.
ðŸ‘§
Nice but took days of students ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜œ
It is very good app for study and official work & meeting in lock down
Nice appðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ–¥ðŸ’»ðŸ“±
It's okay but don't know how to sign up ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Great app. But now there is a problem when I on my video the other participants can't see me and in the participants list it is showing that my video is off. Could the manufacturer check what is the problem
After using the application couple of times shows error whole logging in.... Clarity wise application is amazing but troubles sometimes when a virtual meeting is planned and is urgent.. Please help to fix this for terrific experience..
So so
I can't get the audio to work. How do I get it to work when everything is already on
Ok ok
These was good app but in sigin option their take some changes.
Its good ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
Good
No great audio for good sound mix
This app is good but it's limited time made students worst and this limited time should be remove from this app
The app is good but not much because when zoom meeting is going on we can't call someone or can't search by speaking on any browser plez make a new update and fix thisðŸ™. Thanks ðŸ˜Š.
Not good
I'll have only 3 star because it has small bug which always logout from mail id
Doesn't let me to sign up again
Breaking up real real hard
Good
Very nice aap
Had job interview with California. Didn't feel comfortable because my camera was on while the other side wasn't. Made me feel uncomfortable
Awesome app Please use in lappy or pc
Not a good quality
very effective
Good app but I can't find virtual background option in android
It's nice but not too much.
bad
"There were no issues before the new update .But now, though we kept the camera on, it is being represented that camera is off, so please fix it"
Suppose we can connect bluetooth headset in zoom app instead of headphones please show visibile in participants bluetooth symbol who can connect bluetooth please improve that so everybody likes zoom and add videos in screen sharing and add emoji
Very slow in giving feedback
Uses moreeee data plzz atleast in nxt update try to reduce data
Why Screen Share option Removed?
Really I wanted to give zoom app full ratings but I have a issue that issue is that when we are in meeting when if we switch to other app video will turn off immediately and when we go to participants list video will turn off please I request you to solve this problem many people have this issue so please solve this problem. Other than that all is right.
Good
Latest update is not good as it didn't allow the host to spotlight their own video due to which the participants find difficulty to connect with the host who is taking the meeting especially children.
Video quality is excellent but the reason I can 1 star is voice quality is very bad.
It is very good app for meeting on Android phones
Wonderful
It is the best alternative possible for offline classes. I suggest you one option that there should be any way for admin to know the mobile number of participant so that if any random joins we will get to know atleast the number he/she has used to logged in.
Refresh connection option is required in this app
Disruption in linking is almost equal to normalcy
Good app
"This app is just amazing.... I like the screen sharing most.... The video quality is awesome... The audio is also great but you all can still improve thatðŸ˜ŽBy the way, pls add virtual background option in android .This is my reason for taking away one star away... I hope you'll add that soon.... Pls do fast. .hope you do that.. byeðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž still not done! ðŸ˜³I wi remove one more star for that!"
"Please add and option to delete a message sent in chat, similar to whatsapp"
"Camera goes out of focus in a moment, and whole class become dark, profile picture appears suddenly instead of videos You guys have earned enough Make the free video call limit 70 minutes"
I can't get virtual background option in my phone though I updated it to latest version..
"I don't kn what's happening since last two days .I am a schooling student and it's complusary for me to keep my Video on and even I do , but in participants place frm last two days it is constantly showing that my camera is off .I have also updated the app .So plzz check yr system, facing lots of problem becoz of this and I am very disappointed ."
There is a problem from myside that plz keep dark theme in zoom and plz disable waiting room in zoom it is a headache

When i turn the camera in participants it tells i am not turn the camera
Good app for online classes
"This app was fine before the new update. Even though I can see my video's on, it shows off in the participants list and also others cannot see my video. Then why does it show on to me?? It becomes an issue during online classes. Sometimes after repeating the 'switch - off and on' process multiple times, others can see my video. Though, it is still the same(off) in participants list. Many of the others have written in the review, but the developers are not taking any actions. Kindly fix this."
Latest update is very bad then otherwise it's good
Good
My camera doesn't work. I switch it on from my side but in participants list it's shows off. It needs to be fixed. As I have already uninstalled and reinstalled it thrice but still the problem persists.
Nice
Suggestions: The participant must have to use his email id to join the meeting. Identification of the participant must be clear.
I love the app but I need to go to online classes
ZOOM IS OK.BUT I DON'T FIND IT EASY TO USE AND IT IS ALSO NOT ENOUGH SAFE.WELL IT IS OK IN THE PART OF INTERNET AND I REALLY LOVE IT'S FEATURES.THAT IS WHY I HAVE GIVEN 3 STARS.
video quality is improved some what but audio quality is becoming worse
A bit slow even with good Internet
Better
Sering kluar
The app is good but the developers should include a feature for changing background during meetings.
Not so good sometime it got hang
Before the update this app was great but now whenever I open another window in the background my camera gets turned off automatically. Please fix this!!!!!!!!!!
I want to record zoom meeting with audio but their is no option for that
It's ok
The vedio of other person is not clear
Apss
Good app need a little inprovment
Osm app
After updating the app it's showing me my video off even when it's on. Please look forward this . And fix the problem.
"When the host start sharing screen on that above and below of image a black strip always come and I can't see what is what is written and in zoom app, the quality of audio and video is little bit not good , please solve this problem please."
I join the meeting it automatically disconnected
I have been used this for a long time but I have a problem in it because sometimes it doesn't connects and also it leaves meeting automatically this is the point which me hurt .so please can you fix it I have really faced much problems though it leaves automatically but it is a very useful app for vedio conference and best app for online studies in this covid 19 time
It's quiet good application ðŸ˜Š

Kharab bahut kharab
The recent update has made it worseðŸ˜”
"The service is good, app ux is bad. The main problem is with speaking. If I navigate to another screen in the app, my mic is muted. Why? I need to stay on the speaking screen to keep talking. This is absurd. Learn from google meet guys. They have fantastic ux."
Average
50 50
Good
It's an excellent app for group meatings and online studies....but still giving it three stars because it doesn't records sound in screen recording at the time of meeting going in mobile phones...may the company would read the feedback and resolve it...@zoom.us
"Connecting takes almost 2 minutes, which isnt that bad, but previously it used to connect right away, so ehy can't it now? (but certainly better than previous time.)"

I am genuinely rating this app as three big is the facilities that are provided unlimited not more than hundred people can join in a meeting the meeting blocks when more than hundred people join and you have to create the meeting again and again after 40 minutes that the worst part of the meeting overall the app is good but there are some glitches that the app needs to to explain and correct the Zoom app as the India's number one app thank you so much for providing such great things but you need
This app is very very fine but its complains are not solved in my pc i am not able to join a meeting from many days more than 10 times i sended the report no resolution. Please solve this problem. Rather than this app is great

Pog champ
Good.
Very glitchy at points but is reliable
Ok but sound and quality are regularly cutting off. Skype or Whatsaap are better
Cracking no network
I don't have the virtual background option
Could be better in a lot of ways.
Change the ringing bell to something else cause everytime I join a meeting my dog will bark and disrupt my meeting
"Its good but the sound is going in and out you can barely hear people. You guys have to fix this we have to use this for school,work,and meetings.Can you make this without a lot of problems? I would love that thank you."
It hangs mobile by daily usage
I wold give it a five star only if there was no limit for meeting to end without getting the pro
"Works fine. But has developed a bug with the latest update of the mobile version. As a host, I am unable to share any document or screen with the participants. I am using a Vivo phone for the mobile app. Hope this is corrected soon."
According to me zoom should enable virtual backgrounds in low hand devices.
good app
Filters are still not available in mobile its only background
Breakout Rooms ended up being only one person in the room.

"Unable meeting, no sound. Even set to high volume."
"Been good, but recently the camera has gone way to dark. And not sure why or to fix"
"I don't blame it for the problems because of internet connection...but it should have some kind of pop up for the person who is having connection problem other than the WiFi logo at the corner... because only few notice it, at least the blame won't be passed on to others!"
It is a nice app. But suddenly in the middle of the meeting it gets disconnect and after few seconds it again gets connected. I think there should be some more improvement in this application. Sometimes it takes time to join the meeting.
It is a good app but in the meeting if our network connection cuts qutomatically viedo will off please make any other way that if our viedo offs by network problem please make shure that give any think other way that our viedo should not off
Nice

"Gud app,but plzz remove that mute all option on host's screen!!!apart from that,I like this app!!"

"It's a nice app. However, please you can also upload a feature to record the meeting, which will be much helpful to us."
Little improvement can be done like face filters and background can be added or used in phone rather than using a laptop or desktop for it .
Sometimes links not connecting
I can't put video filters or virtual background on Mobile And it is creating alot of problems . I don't want use it but my school classes is on zoom app .that's why I can not stop using it .this is like we don't want to eat food but for survival I need to eat
This app is good but not best
"Good App, Helpful"
Thank you for zoom
"it is good but this update has bugs ,although i unmute my video but it is showing mutted in participants list...please update"
Good
Its virtual background is not working after the update also so plz see this problem
If i open participants and the chat box or when i open any other app like WhatsApp my video is getting off ..this update is not good ...
Very good app I like it but virtual background should be there. Very bad experience in my life they are telling that virtual background support to android and android means mobile. When I saw that virtual background to mobile I was so happy and when I update it nothing.ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ . I am telling that no one should download it. Hmm... Bogas app
lk
Good app and nice working also but time limits is only of 40 min as compared to meet.. So by the way good app..
App is good but it accepts only 4g data and uses so much battery. like for one and a half hour it uses my 32percent of battery without heating
"I take my online classes on zoom. When I go for the chat box , my video gets off and my teacher yell on me because we are not allowed to turn off the video during class.... Please improve that !!!!!!ðŸ˜ž"

"What's new? Virtual background support for Android, but no. How can I use that feature?"
eh
I really don't know who installed this on my phone but it had 3 problems. The first is about when my video is on in the participants button but i don't see MY face. The second is it keeps logging me out of my account!. The third one is I cannot hear the audio even tho my phone audio is high already. PLEASE fix this and if you fixed this I will rate it back to 5 stars again.Thank you.
I don't have any experience with zoom
"This app has come a long way on Android. However, please add the ability to view more than four people in Gallery view for Android Tablets, specifically for the Samsung Galaxy Tab series. The only thing holding back the tablets are companies like Zoom giving the apps comparable tablet support like they do for iPadOS."
I recently upgraded to Zoom Pro but I don't see any of the screen controls featured in Zoom Pro on my screen. Do I need to re-upload Zoom? What I've had up until I upgraded to Pro was the free basic plan.
Not so good
Ok
It will not let me see other participants in gallery view. I have to swipe through the screens to see all participants on the zoom meeting. That is Very frustrating!!!!
Good
Please tell me how to restore the previous version.
Phone in participants are unable to join meeting even when using password. Told they cannot use! Have sent a total of 3 tickets without a response or resolution! Why?? What is the solution? Fix it and you get anothet star!
great
"In this app all is well but a new update came which support virtual backgrounds for Android but when I open the app there is no option of virtual backgrounds I want virtual backgrounds for Android Plz,plz,plz,plz,plz,plz, Please Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please"

If I do a zoom na meeting can I get a conformation that I did a meeting?
Nice app for student
Every time i open the app. It doesn't show the previously joined meetings. Apart from that all good.

Good
Dont fix the bug
I need virtual background for Android and how to set it should be mentioned
Good
"This app was working well but from some couple of months it had many new bugs. Whenever I open any another app while in meeting, I automatically get removed from meeting. So this is thing is to be improved."
The update said that it can use virtual background for android now. But I can't find it on my zoom.
Midiyam
It does not have the option of virtual background on mobile .
Fine...video problem is there very much
Question: how can I create a break-out group if I only have a tablet and not a laptop? Please answer this question.
It is showing my video off at participants when it showing on
"Not very user-friendly. This morning I was scheduled for a job interview at 9 a.m. and the host came on and we were able to see one another, but, we couldn't hear one another. No matter what I tried, the audio wouldn't function."
Very nice app for online class. ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
Still no option for virtual backgrounds. What's up with this?
"I like this app but the reason I give it three stars because it's capacity is very low only 100 people can join and the time limit is too short , only 40 mins time is there so these were two things which I don't like but my family members stay far so we can be connected with them"
"The new update is showing some glitches if one switch app then it shows that video has been turned off, which not a good feature."
"Actually I want to give 5-star rating for this app but I gave only three because 1) I get disconnected from meeting even if my network is strong 2) I don't like that showing mirror of my video but it is necessary because if we turn it off and then use back camera to show our book, it looks terrible"
This app is good but my video is on but in participants list it is coming off why is this so and this is not happening only with me it is happening with some of my friends too plz to something
Please fix the glitches.... ðŸ’”
Hope zoom will improve chat facilities Delete for everyone msg can also be improve
It's real a good app with awesome features for social networking.But some of the devices cause audio and video problem.

"This app is good but not that much. It is running properly before the latest update but when I updated it to the latest version It stops representing the camera on. I think this is a bug in this app. I request the manufacturers to fix this bug in the next update. And the voice quality is also not that much good after network is good or bad.

"Whenever I share my screen on my mobile with a smart TV while using zoom, the audio does not transfer to the TV. This only happens with zoom. Also, when I pair with a Bluetooth speaker, the audio is really poor. Also only happens with zoom. I use an S10."
I was using this app from almost 7 months it was working very nice but just after the recent update when I exit the app ðŸ‘‰ðŸ“±for time it pause our video or cameraðŸ“·ðŸ“·ðŸ“¹ðŸ“·ðŸ“¹ I didn't like that and one more thing I was using it from so much time but I was facing so much net issue after this update so please fix this issue.
It's a good app but I am too angry that their is no virtual background option in my phone I saw so many videos about virtual background in phone
Official accessories.

Unable to connect
Using since april 2020 and working fine till august but now recent update is faulty and it automatically turn off or got hang or not clear audio-video... I have tried on good network but same happens.
This is an best app for teaching but this app takes more battery life than other apps...
Everything is fine but sometimes the meeting doesn't connect with mobile data and virtual background is also not working in Android even after update.
This is a very ggod app...with the help of this is app we can communicate with our teachers ....we can see them and talk with them if we have any problem...but this app has some demerits too...problem no 1 of this app is outsider people can enter in your meeting and create some terrible problem...avoiding its demerits its a very good app...
à¦ªà¦°à¦¿à¦šà¦¿à¦¤ à¦ªà¦°à¦¿à¦šà¦¿à¦¤ à¦ªà¦°à¦¿à¦šà¦¿à¦¤ à¦ªà¦°à¦¿à¦šà¦¿à¦¤
Today my network is exelent.....but it is showing log in failed pls check your connection. Why it is showing that

Zoom
Not able to set virtual background on my mobile phone. Also can't see multiple spotlights fixed on mobile.
"During the meeting, my video was on, but in the participants list it is showing that my video is off. Please see to it and change its feature."
Nice app
It crashes a lot.
Not support vartual background in redmi note 9
It does the job
I use it all the time but on android I can't do background
This update is very good day but there is no facility of virtual background.
App is nice but sometimes there are technical problems
"Why there is no option for Virtual background in Android, which is in Iphone?"
"This was a great app. But,now it has very big problem of sound.I can't listen anything in the meeting.So,i request to serve the same service like before as soon as possible."
Sounds not clear to Liston
Cost Too much money for the upgrade plan. There should be more than 40min. Should be unlimited. Especially since our world has so many challenges and this is one of the options to keep in contact with each other.
This app has some viruses... After once downloading and installing I'd to do it from my internal app.. as it had virus.. and also it takes a lot of internet. Sometimes it tends to show network problems..
I'd rate it 5 stars if there was a background option for Android.
alr but there's always some type of lag or disfunction.
"So it was all pretty good until lately that I've started having this problem were anytime I turn on the camera, the audio of the call starts sounding robotic and it cuts off, as if I was connected to a very bad WiFi signal, but it's not the WiFi because my signal is fine. Please if you could reach out to me and solve this it would be great because I need the camera for my university classes, it's a requirement to have it on to prove your assistance"
"Was VERY good before last update (late Sept. 2020), but now the video freezes every 3 seconds or so (all: mine and other participants). The same change happened in 2 different Android devices with the latest update. Please fix! (and test better before releasing updates in the future :)"
Sometimes its chappy
Poor Network connections
Good
It's being late to open
How can we add virtual background
"Bad reception, keeps timing out"

"Iam getting videos full in dark like photo negative, not able to detect problem"
This aap is very easy to use
Everything in the app is great but I would like if an option to create alternate host(Second one who could start the meeting )could be there. It would be helpful for many people like me who has to teach or present with a patner .
I can't use vertual background
Its grate for my students

It cant connect if there is no internet and there must be an assistant for every one who are in the meeting...
NiceðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
There are many bugs in new update
Audio and video are not clear
"Excellent Features but I have to coach almost all my clients on how to enable audio and video... why do they have to click so many buttons to join audio. They don't know what ""internet audio"" means so it's confusing to even young people and a pain to deal with for every client I have to teach. Zoom nailed everything except this... and It's a video call for goodness sakes! Please change ""internet audio"" to ""click here for sound,"" if it's too much to ask for an auto connect option."
I have given only 3 stars because there is always voice problem in every class
Nice app
Voice quality not good
Its a good app. But these days it is making some problems. During a meeting my video is on but it shows my video of to everyone in meeting. Kindly help me the developer. Thnx !

# Bakvas app #nobody use this bakas #Sound problem
Hii Team Zoom App My Problem is this app is hack my personal data ?
Sound problem in this app so please solve this problem and give 5 star so fast solve this audio problem
good app but it takes lot of time to connecting
ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰This app is very good for online study but there is very network problem and if the zoom can do full screen mode ( not show back button) and less network problem so it run most faster âš¡âš¡
Fairly clear sound
"A lot of issues are faced, even if I keep my video on it shows off in the participants list and at the receiving end it keeps on going on and off. Also anytime the meeting gets ended. i. e b4 40 mins."
1. Uses a alot of battery
Add a 'zoom to fill screen' feature for meeting videos.
Good

"The updated version is worst than the previous one everything upgraded but i think they missed the audio quality , i feel like from the day i have updated zoom it's audio quality has become the worse , it's getting disconnected at low network as well as at high speed internt also but earlier even if the network was slow the video becomes blurred but the audio was clear & now it's opposite ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª"

"Good app, but 18% battery usage in 1 hour, and 1 meeting can be extended upto 40 minutes. There should be an option to choose the meeting duration. Otherwise multiple functions...."
I have been using the app from April with no problem at all. But with the recent update Zoom is showing glitches. It is draining too much internet and even though my video is on in the participants it is not showing. It is also having noise suppression problem. Can please fix it because it is becoming difficult for me to do school classes. The in-built report problem system is not functioning properly because there is no response from you guys.
It is good but when I attend a meeting the camera in the participants list shows off but in main screen it is on after the new update it is so useless if I close all background apps also and I have uninstall and reinstall it many times ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ and please look after it
Usefull for learning

It's a good app but I am facing too much problems now It shows that I haven't turned my video on though I turn it on.........
"I have updated it ,but it is showing that my camera is off in participant list. Please do something"
Sometimes I can't Join meetings so I am giving it 3 stars otherwise I would give it 5 stars
I would like to put 4 star but there a big problem with the app. Because I have zoom meeting and the problem in there is the teacher see us like we didn't open cam but in our perspective we open the cam and the huge problem in our cam is open but in the participant room is not open and pls change it so I don't have to worry about it. Pls fix the problem â€¢wâ€¢
Average

Sound
"My next update was that I can share device audio on my android phone. But it doesn't seem good to me . I can't change the visual background too meanwhile, it written there that you can change the visual background. Fixe this problem."
This is a good app but we can't put backgrounds in mobile devices so I am giving it 3 stars
I am getting 104114 error code error when attempting a to join a meeting. Whst is this for?
"Too many glitches, you need to go back to the solid red indicator for the camera and microphone. Was hard for the elderly to see if they are muted or not."
good
The signal went in and out.
Audio issues
It is good for student as well as for teaching but some says it has virus ðŸ˜·ðŸ¤’ or hacking system that will collapse our phone. In lockedðŸ” it is most beneficial ðŸ‘‰ðŸ“±
"Whenever I unmute myself, I couldn't hear the other participants' audio when we are speaking simultaneously. What seems to be the problem? Is it my phone or the app's malfunction? I hope this problem would be fixed asap. Zoom is a great app and can be considered essential now for the meetings we have, adapting to the new normal situation during the pandemic."
You want to extend the time but it's nice
Excellent application
Easy to use
The audio is skipping during meets whats the problem?
ðŸ‘
This app is only for online classes or any video conferencing but the main issue is there should be more emojis.
ðŸ™…ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸
Communication was not clear for both end
It good
The last update on my Pixel made my camera unusably dark and I am unable to use video while working from home now. My phone camera works fine outside of the app.
Needs to be upgraded to a better UI.
"This update say it enables virtual background for Android, but I don't see any option for background in application, so.... it's there or not?"
Use Zoom maybe once every two weeks. When not actually using Zoom i was surprised to find it was the #1 battery background draining app on my Android 9 device. Force stopped/hibernate Zoom and now battery life is back to normal. I prefer Google Duo and only use Zoom when required by meeting hosts or administrators. Thank you â˜ºï¸
not bad
Nice Hi
I used this app as an online classes for my school. And it was awesome. I really loved it. Bt since yesterday the app is being updated due to which whenever I go to the participants list or to any other web page my video automatically turns off. And due to which whenever we have exams on Google forms automatically the video gets turned off. And it is becoming a serious issue. Hope u will try the best to make some changes. Thank you
Too much lag
Nice
I love this app but it's high MB that's why u want delete and dowlond please make zoom lite also it's my request please ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™
It would be ok if we could change name instead of having to use numbers to try to get into classes that won't let you in because you can't change to name. Students need names not number to connect to their classes or they can't get to on line class. Need to fix this problem .
Distorted sounds and unclear screen splits
Good
How would you expect students to give you a high rating?
i downloaded already the latest version of this app. But i can't find the virtual background option when i joined the meeting... ðŸ˜” im disappointed
Ok
"The reason I gave Zoom a 3 stars is because when I connect I can't get the speaker off mute. I tried everything, it just won't unmute and my Doctor and I have to revert to just a telephone call. Other than that, the view is fine. ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘ðŸ•ŠðŸ¦‹. 9/24/2020."
It is very nice app

"There is one issue with app as I updated app the camera sign is always showing off,others can see me and my camera sign on but, I can see it off so please zoom resolve my issue as online classes are going on. Can you resolve my issue??"
"I love this application but the problem is that the meeting can not go more than an hour, may you please make it possible for, just one hour in minimum please."
Why I cannot see and change my profile? Otherwise I would give 5 star.
This app is amazing ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜„ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ verygood

"For the most part, my experience with Zoom has been really positive, but sometimes, right in the middle of a meeting, I'll be booted out of the meeting. It happened at least 7 times tonight during a meeting that lasted 2 1/2 hours. It's very aggravating and I hope there's some way you can fix it so this won't happen anymore."
Good
I would simply say one thing cheesy!
Very nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ for learning
This is a good application for study or also for business
This is good but some problems are there like voice and camera problem but good
"Thanks for solving our audio issue in new updates. But one problem is there, when my video is on, then also in participating, it is showing off. That's why, my online class school teacher is not taking my attendance."
Shreeraj wagh WaghIn zoom my host and friends voice is breaking in my phone there is internet then also it is breaking
VIRTUAL BACKGROUND OPTION IS NOT IN ZOOM ANDROID 10
"The app is good . But after updating I anable to change my name , change settings"
i am not able to connect to the meeting and i have also sent report problem but you are not responding why?
Okay
Please add some new features like visual backgrounds which are in laptops and pcs but please make it avaliable to android apps too now in zoom as we r updating it is becoming worst
Not as expected. The occurrence of connectivity problems is common and it is not so because of network problem but there are issues related to zoom. The audio and video is not that clear as advertisedðŸ™„ðŸ˜§.Yes it is good when u don't have any other option. I will recommend to improve this app a little bit and modify the issuesðŸ˜ðŸ˜‘.
Good
it is apsalutly good but sounds quality is not good
Nice aapðŸ˜…
Why did you update it??
It is a very good app for students who attend online classes
Good
average
Please ðŸ¥º provide screen recording with audio for zoom
Its good but the quality not super some times goes and comes
I like this gpp
Please add virtual background on android...i'll give it 5
Had network problem often
I can't seem to find my profile but I am able to see it through if I close my video-_-
Zoom is where I do my class but sometimes it leaves the meeting by itself and then renter and most time you can't hear what the person who is talking says
Poop
Its a fine app i use it for school
"The new features of the latest update, is it available to all android users? Secondly, is it available to android users with basic package? I'm asking because I've updated my zoom (basic) on my android phone (infinix hot 8) but can't see the new features that accompanies the latest update. Example: share device audio, virtual background support etc."
Hopefully this app works better this Time
Always lagging .sometimes difficulty in connecting please improve your app
"It does what it says, the UI is still messy though with options here there and everywhere in or out of meetings. One thing I should add; the app description says virtual background has been added. This is true, up to a point - two handsets here, same app version installed on both, and it's available on one but not the other. Whether the difference is the chipset (one handset has SD, the other does not) or something else though who knows, hopefully future updates will tell us."
ðŸ‘Œ
Bluetooth does not work
It was Okay
It is very good app it helps with school but it will sometimes let me in a meeting then kick me out
"Everything works well, except the virtual background on android. I'm using Redmi Note 8 and the option for virtual background is not there, which means I cannot activate it. I don't know if it's my phone who doesn't support the feature, but if it's a bug please fix this. Thank you"
Aps is working good but only qtn is not available.
Nice
"Not so bad. But the supporting sector can add the option of *rejoin*, along with end or leave meeting, so that time will be reduced. Also try to cancel over internet consumption. One meeting in your zoom app takes along upto 500 MB and above. So try to reduce this issue. Also try to enable voice message send button in the chat so it's easy to send voice message. Otherwise great. Congratulations keep doing well. Please enable the rejoining button along with Leave meeting & end meeting."
Zoom is really helpful during quantine
Good
How do you turn on the virtual background? The usability really sucks
VOICE QUALITY SUCKS.
Very helpful app. But need to be more featured.
Good....really happy after the updateðŸ˜Š
Good but not cool
Short time session.
Ni ukweli
It Is the worst app when I Screen share it automatically stop share. And it has lot problem
Audio is not good enough
"When I log in my cellphone it goes smoothly-ish, but when I log in my computer, there ia always problems with screen sharing that affects audio and camera, and connection."
It ok just a little bit more hard with a phone
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
All is ok but ultimate is not coming to sign in correct email and correct password I had kept all correct but coming Invalid email r password that only bad
It gets disconnected during meetings.
not bad
Can't sign up
Should not charge money at all
Many things about video should be corrected
The sound gets disturbed in a Bluetooth speaker. So please fix this
Good
Fabulous App for meeting but One problem when host remove us by mistake we not able to connect again And it take to much mb.
Three stars only because when we start a meeting it will reconnect an reconnect
V à¤¬à¤¹à¥à¤¤ à¤…à¤šà¥à¤›à¤¾
"It takes too much of internet, only if It have optionâ€“where I could change video quality like in Youtubeâ€“I wouldn't mind giving Five Stars."
I didn't get the virtual background experience in android phone
"Totally useless app. We are worrying about our daily needs in COVID19, and teachers are busy taking live classes."
Nb
"Good..but when i forget to disable the permission for data access, my data finishes earlyðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©"

That's helpful
Amazing app for meetings and online classes but it has some flaws also like sometimes we can't unmute.but in my opinion it is better than other meeting app and it also does not consume much mobile data.For online classes during lockdown zoom is best option .
Average
Liked it
good
It's very wonderful app but u can change some while I will seeing classes it will strucking ðŸ™ good app ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
Suddenly can't share screen with ipad. I even tried ipad with ios 14 which is the newest but still can't.
There must be an option to change profile photo
In the description of the new update it was written 'virtual background support for android' but there is no such featuretill now. Rest all is fine.
I really need virtual background for android
Super app
Nice but not nice
Good quality
Nice app. But I don't like when we login in the zoom as host because of that two stars reduced.and we can't hear our voice.
There are days when the connection is horrible
"I use Teams and zoom both, but ofcourse, Teams is miles ahead when it comes to being a top-class meetings app."
Zoom is really a good video conferencing app but this days the voice is not clear neither mine nor others.
Hi share screen not working from Last update
It's good but it gets hang some times But it's really useful and nessary ðŸ˜… Thank u for this wonderful app ðŸ˜Šâ˜ºï¸ðŸ˜Œ
Good app
It's such a good application but zoom cannot work when I connect to WiFi.Why?Other applications work when I connect to Wifi.This app use many data.
Ok ok
I can't find virtual background ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ though it is updated What can I do now?
Bad meeting app when 20 days go it take a update of 17.41MB so I could not take a meeting properly.
Please resolve the issue of camera there has something wrong with it please check it out as soon as possible
Good
"I like Zoom but one of the trouble spots is the permissions a co-host has. A co-host cannot setup breakout rooms while another host is managing other meeting details. Breakout room management, if you have to do it manually, is a huge job if you have a lot of people in your meeting, and it would help if the 2nd host could do it! Please change co-host permissions!"
Its helped in in covid 2020
Good
Students' voices are not heard in the meeting date : 22 september after. And Zoom is much hotter than using the app.
c.ififf
Helpfull
Better than any other app
Good
Now now...guess what..after today's update I am not able to use share screen option....Seriously..I mean what's going on ??
Missed 2 classes because it said the meeting ID was incorrect
That is very good and important app in the lock down.
Gggg
It is lagging in new update and make every device backround
Good
Good only
Unable to share the device audio though I have updated the app
"Well it's a good app but the problem is that if a participant has less data, he faces a lot of troubles.. moreover, it doesn't gets connected.. secondly, when I host a meeting in my PC, I change the settings to allow multiple participants to share the screen at a time.. but it never occurs.. only single participant can share the screen.. in PC, i can never share my screen of the zoom meeting.. whereas I can share it in a mobile.. so I want to know the reason.."
Rahat mehra
"It is really best a app for meetings , because they use cloud meeting formula and it is loosing two stars because they didn't kept an virtual background for android ,if they try they can do but they didn't so."
ðŸ˜
Nice app for online classes tq for this app
I think this app should have more development
This app is helpful
"Best, but 40 minutes only meeting"
Good but not the best
I has first given 5 stars but then i has given it as 3 stars.I like this app but there is one problem.The chat message that has once gone cannot be deleted.so please fix some bug so that the message that has once gone can be deleted
Good application ðŸ‘ðŸ‘

Accha hai par kabhi kabhi kuch ho jata hai ZOOM ko jiske vajha sai chalta nahi hai par fir bhi accha hai
Good app
After this newest update in my online classes I can't chat with participants privately I can only chat with host or co-host please get that feature back please!!
Is mein koi bhi video open karta hai to video bhot atakta hai
Ok

"This application has good video and audio quality best for online classes. But some times there is a problem that I can't enter the meeting and some times I can't hear the voice of the host, I have to reenter to get the voice and at that time I would miss the important parts of the class Respected developers... please fix this problem."
It is good for students ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘
You must keep Virtual background for android usersðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

Its good but how do i set a pic? and i can't sign up
There was a problem always breaking of voice . And where is the chat option in updated version
"It's not optimized for tablets. You only see 4 people per screen, which is annoying (25 for tablets, 9 for phones would be better)"
Nice app.No problem but I hope there is a background filter for the ANDROID VERSION
Some time is good
It is not possible to use virtual background on android version10
Tic tac ha
There's a lot of disturbance in the meeting I checked my network bandwidth it's high
Sometimes the meeting pause automatically even if having a good network connection. These problems should be fixed soon
P90
Nice
In the latest update in participants list it was showing that my video is off but when I checked it my video was on pls check this problem in the app
I am not at all satisfied with this app because I am not able to join the meeting though I have good network connection. I am missing my important lectures because of this. Please fix this as soon as possible.
"This function is not there and it is written in the new features that there is this function but ist is not there, Virtual Background support for Android Meeting features"
GoodðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Its Nice but the main issue is it freezes all the time . That's very disappointing.
better
Good
I m not using it before
"As I have updated the app to latest version, it is telling that virtual background support is there for android but can you tell me how to enable it."
It is a good app i have some problem that it is stycking so i have missed half of my class can u please check it
It was very nice
Rest everyone is fine but u should enable virtual background support on Android phones too and please lower the qualifications for applying virtual background on Mac.
It is not a secure app. But I think it is easy to use and helpful
Good application
full slow working
Nyc
I love it !!because its very nice for children but I rate only 3stars ðŸ˜Š
There is still issues with the video randomly reconnecting and sometimes it won't connect. I have no problem with the firewall and my connection is not unstable. Please fix this.
Good
It is helpful and comfortable for online classes.
Very useful in this pandemic situation ..but got so many issues related to app ..and also network issues .
MD
Very nice app Tanks
Good
Amazing Meeting App ðŸ‘
it is having audio problem after the last update
Zoom is good
Controls aren't good but still it is a good meeting app
It uses up a lot of network. Over all good experience.
This app is very good for online learning but there are some network issues with me when ever I join a meeting it takes too much time for joining the meeting so i will only give 3 stars.
"I dont know what is wrong with this app...i had a class and i couldnt attend it becoz the audio didnt connected for good 30 min and after that i had to leave the meeting ...i have missed my 5 classes becoz of that ...please fix these issues becoz we cant afford problems with such apps because for many they arent source of entertainment and family meetings ..we do all our formal ,office related stuff here"
"Its good, but i think the old version was better"
For asking for pro
i love this
Sometimes there is too much disconnection during the meeting. Error also occurred.
When I join the meeting it sometimes show incorrect password
Nice
Not bad
That's great
Best but video quality is not good
Nice app but not very nice app
Ok
Sometimes it's very useless
"It consumes a lot of data depends on the video spotlighted. Please add host setting ""video output resolution"" like 360p 240p or 480p etc. Not all can have unlimitted data and fast internet."
nice.apk unhaackable
The last September update the start the zoom mettring than network connection problem show net speed is good but show the error continues

"It could be worse, and it could be better. Its not super buggy, but it can be a bit confusing."
Thanks so much for the update and for the zoom meeting it is very important and nice
Sahi app ha
This is loser app

Ololl
"works grate, is there a way of seeing more than just four ppl in one screen ?? please let me know thanks. On an Hp chrome book, also add the feature of changing your background"
Juss which I could move my box icon where ever I want to
High quality. S vedio and mettings on beautiful graphics
I use it because everybody else uses it and I have to and I'm glad it exists but it is really not my favorite app
ADD VIRTUAL BACKROUND TO ANDROID
I think it would be better to have small groups of classmates that can work together on questions.
Difficult. Need AA.
High pitch sound cuts off completely.
Great bout data
"When using a usb webcam if select no video, zoom crashes. Lately on both computer and mobile phone getting crackly, statiky audio. Instead of getting better, getting worse. Thinking of cacelling paid subscription"
"It just doesn't work for me, I tried I think I'll only be able to use that if I have a computer"
A lot of pixelation and issues even with strong wi-fi.
Its good but its not too safe..
Can you let me know why I cannot download zoom on my Hp chromebook
Is good but net work affect line
Recoding not possible via mobile
Y thus video is blurry and voice is breaking even though the network is good but still the voice is breaking.... Y
I use in a limited capacity hence 3 stars try it ya might like it
Can't access my settings easily. Speed is bad. Not finding the information I need.
This helps in animal studies my online class is been held in this app
NiceðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
I don't know about this app in 2019 and it became almost my school in 2020
Its good ! What else can l say ??ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘
"Appreciated this app because it is very useful to one and all in these covid times as everybody can virtually contact with everyone. As a student, I feel it is an amazing app as it connects many other students also even the whole class can attend meeting and will not suffer from studying. But it has major bugs which needs to be fixed so that we can easily attend the meeting without any error code. Thanks and Regards"
This is good app for studying purpose as well... My daughter studying from this app ..
Abbb this app can't present the screen and the worst thing is the chat disabled option......... But it shows nice screen abd i like that we can send some messages privately to anyone bcauz of this we can chat in any meeting ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Virtual background system is not available on Android. Which is a very bad thing. And unlike by most.
"Am new, expecting to have a great experience with the app"
Masih belum di perbaiki bug macet ketika meeting
Amazing app for online studies but one day it was having problem in the software and i even checked it from 4 other devices and it still didn't work that day so because of that i missed my classes :-\ secondly i think it should add fun features other than raising hand >.<
Audio toomuch ...video issues automatically turned off
Not Bad
Very nice ðŸ‘ and helpful application but some issues in this application
It is ok
Why isnt green screen on zoom for me?
Virtual background option for android should be given and full screen video like for pc and ios should be given
Not best.....ðŸ™ðŸ™
Its a good app for online classes but i also faced a lot problems with this app we also required a powerful internet connection then only the app is useful
The app is very good but it takes nearly 77.7 MB for a 40 minutes class plz can you make it to take less data charges plz I have 4 classes and it is taking 1.5 GB for classes I have to write notes also so
Good app but sometimes it gives network error. I would request to solve this
Good performance

Not a good app
"A Facult in the app, Unable to screen record the meeting in phone , and saying microphone is busy ,which can be done in other app like WebEx and Google meet, dear zoom support Plz consider and correct it. Thankyou."
Would be beneficial if there is an adjustment for zoom in and zoom out option built-in into the app !
"Bro,all thing is correct but you should want to remove chat disabled option and add group chat option at meeting time."
ok
Dont like i lime duo
Good and bad
"Google meet is 50 times better than zoom, meet takes less net . But several times I can't join my class through zoom and it takes soo much time to join. But, in one position zoom is good, for its auto connect facility. Zoom have to improve, connection problem."
Hlo... my account had suddenly blocked plzz do this for me
I would give 5 star but chatting is not comfortable and file sharing option during meeting on Android is missing . Please do add this file sharing feature on Android app. Thanks
Bad zoom app is not working properly 1 problem I face the sound of host in the meeting was not clear so I request developer's please fix this problem

Use full app but safety problem
I have a suggestion for this app. Can you please make it 500 maximum or higher? I am sorry if I am demanding but our teacher always suggests this app for online classes yet students are many that can't join because it's already full. I am hoping that you'll add this to your new update if ever. Please. ðŸ¥º
Uuuu
"i m using samsung galaxy pro 7. i cannot find the virtual background function. i was told it should be on bottom righr side under MORE. but there is no such function there. at home when i use the PC to install virtual background, my bedroom image n the virtual background were overlapping each other. and my face has a lot of white light. very frustrating"

It is what it is.
Its a good app for attending lectures and classes. But it takes a lot of time to join a class or video chat. And sometimes it shows a network failure.. So plzz see to this problem otherwise it is a good one.
Nice but there must be a record feature in it because we use the app for online classes
Upadate still has audio issues

"Please add a function where we can send image,pdf, contact or any attachments in the chat section... during class it is very important to send task to students"
Overall this app is good but many times I can't join the meeting . So can you please see the problem
"I gave it 3 star because many times I was unable to join I t was showing "" connecting "" for a long time .I begg you to report this app"
Useful

No option to switch audio to Bluetooth speaker. Can only play through phone speaker
Good
It's good...but doesn't have message deleting option..
ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
Zoom is very inclusive aap it is very helpful aap studen and teachrs
Nice app but takes most of net or GB from your mobile ...I think if this could be better it will be a boon for me and there is sometimes zoom sign it shows incorrect password even if it is correct Well in my thought I will say others to download it 50 %and 50%not..
Good before
Please improve graphics
It is good but I will 3 stars because it hangs a lot in mobile and also we have to do many many settings on this you can cover this mistake.
"Its great! But I can't apply a background without a green one. And i can't apply background in phone. Sometimes when a call comes and when I decline it the voice becomes so low I can barely hear it, but only sometimes. Otherwise, good to goðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š. The devlopers please look"
This is very important because very long many humans are helping people to get to know each other's parents in the same manner that the person who has a relationship is not the only person in their lives that can help you get through it all and will not have a relationship to be with them and that they don't have to do anything about you and your family and your friends or friends or your friends and your friends are going to be sure you are not a relationship with them or you are not a good
Always voice not clear in meeting
nice. .still need improvementðŸ˜Š
Even the signal strength is good..iam unable to join the meeting sometimes...
Excellant
85 percent of the world's mobile users have Android OS and still ZOOM decides not to make the virtual backgrounds available on its Android app. What a pity!!!
Not bad
Good
It would have been a 4 star but when you switch to any other screen the audio in the video doesn't come. Please fix this issue
I need more features in this app after updating the features I will give 5 stars
Nice
Needs more features
"This is the best experience, but it will not let me sign in my email. Please try to fix this. Thanks."
Intruppted meeting
It's ok
Bad
Ask users to uninstall it's 98 mb it should be 30 mb or 28 mb with audio zoom number password.
Network unfriendly
Its a good app for classrooms but the screen sharing is broken and crashes all the time and makes the host leave and come back.
It's a good app but take lots of internet
It's a good aap but after first successful meeting its starts taking lots of time to connect aprox . 7-10 min.
Ok
I'm Not able to download this app
Lagging
I m trying to sign up but it's not giving me permission and it consumes battery a lot........
I am not able to join meetings. It is showing error.
Good
It's very handy though..But sometimes cant attend a meeting even with a good network..so sometimes miss important things
Fair
"This is a good meeting app in comparison to other apps available. In its previous version, it had a lot of problems, but now after the update the app runs smoothly but still consumes a lot of battery."
While connecting to Bluetooth headset there is visible latency in sound. I don't able to take classes
it is good to communicate others and to see them by in this app.
Sometimes zoom doesn't work .
Slide useful.
Good
"i cant connect to audio just says ""connect to internet"""
Most of the time I can't hear what the host talking..
ati na bhi achha ni ha
Shreya
"I am sending this emoji ""ðŸ¥¸"" emoji again and again. But why why it's not goingðŸ¤”. Fix this problem as soon as possible."
"Its a good platform for meetings and classes virtually. One thing that really pisses me of sometimes is when you close the video before the meeting begins, it stays open at times."
It would be REALLY HELPFUL if you let the users RECORD the AUDIO with any recording apps & with any android versions. Please consider that. I need to record my classes.
N ..
It is not nice app ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Hmmm.... Not bad
Nice app for group meeting
Not good
I think this app uses our personal details
Nice app
Nice
This very useful app for me
I dont like it at all but the problem is that my school uses it i have to be patient with it like i cant even sign up at all and nothing is good there in my opinian and plus i started finding audio problem ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ
"Can be improved in chat system by giving option of sharing photos,videos,and voice messages"
Guys the app is fantastic
Gd
Good
Nice app for video conference more asu like
Good
It has many issues network is not available properly
2rd
This is good actually but there's no clarity of a meeting unless we create an id in zoom it's a very hectic process to do....
Why are some of the features not available on android phones?
"Good, but not that faster. Simple as that."
Audio not audible while recording the meeting..........
Very good
This zoom meeting in my phone is working very good ðŸ˜€but i rate only 3ðŸ™‚ star because in my phone it can not ture on the video in J2 ProðŸ˜° it can ture on the video in my mom phoneâ˜ºaudia is not good when it not working when it working i can't leand full lesson with my oniline class of couse when covid 19 ohh i think you know all that we can't study in school we alway study by oniline that we use zoom but zoom make our so worry because the audia is when it not working we can't leand our lesson.
I love this app but it says that connecting but take lots of time to connect ðŸ˜§Pls solve this problem l don't want this to be done
Useful app but very confusing
Takes too long to download
Network is slow
Very bad its video is not turning on
"It's okay I guess But there's one problem with it, it's background and audio it is very disturbing, if you try to listen it just mutes itself and turns black so please fix the problem"
ðŸ‘
The speaker voice is very low while not using microphone. Please make an option to incresase volume for non-microphone users
Maybe log
Some reason
Super Duper app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘©ðŸ˜Š
It's good aap for meetings
"Its good, but consumes lot of net"
Nice
App is very nice but you should update the settings Only In computer or laptop there is options for background it should be in android phone also .
This is a very helpful app . It helps me a lot during the lockdown but some of the times it shows that there is an unknown error so please solve this problem otherwise it's all good in this app.
ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜Very nice App only zoom ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜
App is okay and good for online classes and meetings but the automatic frequent log outs creates all the fuss. It leads to loss of various important points during a meeting and a class. Rectify it.
Nice
Please add virtual background in mobile phone also
Rajarshi only virtual background is not good there should be a default virtual bc in zoom
"From the time i updated the audio is worst worst worst ,before i updated it used to work fine very fine. Pls pls pls fix thisðŸ˜¯"
Okay
"Dear zoom, From the recent update we havent been getting full screen in our phone Pls do something"
The reason why i am giving only 3 stars is .. sometimes not sometimes almost everytime my mic gets glichted and my teacher unmutes me but i am not able to speak because of this we get scolded by our teachers with no reason ðŸ™„ ... you must fix this problem as soon as possible ðŸ˜‘
Kunal shitke
It is very good app for the studies and useful for the online classes
This new version is really good (only in 6+ android versions) .In android 5 this app is too slow and drains battery too much..I kindly request you to fix this problem and to provide more options for next update ...
Super
It lags a lot.Now I cant talk about my new invention about candles!ðŸ”ª
Because this we have online classes 7 hrs a day ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Very Good

Worst app its very very difficult to join a meeting if our net is slow â˜¹ï¸
In admin when we share screen we get notifications when participant join to waiting room but in notifications we can't let them join meeting over there. Notifications should be changed with admit option.

Zoom should be more optimised as it leads to the rising temperature of phone it should be more lighter.hope Zoom Team will fix this
Always a challenge. I hope others take over. Sad we have to use it
"I hate this app it is going in worst condition its images, audio is not proper"

Some improvements still needed... otherwise good.
"Its good. However if you have a lenovo e10 tablet the sound quality is terrible. It seems that zoom software clashes with dolby atmos which is installed as standard. Tried turning on original sound, everything. Microphone either hear nothing or constant crackley feedback. Impossible to have a meeting."
Overheats on my phone just about all the time making it very hard to use.
Good
mucho eco y se congela la imagen

"The app isn't saving on my sd card,although it can. The reason? Whenever a link comes to you when it's sent by someone, Zoom directs you to re download"
Good
Good!
I have tech issues when I run both audio and video at the same time. This makes it difficult to understand what's happening in the meetings sometimes.
"Good application, but one of its major flaws is the inability to disable participants' cameras, or hide them in cases where you aren't the host. There is also the issue of having the wide range of settings available in the mobile version as is present in the desktop and browser versions. Very inconvenient! I hope this will be sorted in future updates."

I give three stars . You have to fix some bugs. And please enable changing background on android too.
I still haven't use it yet that's why I am only giving 3. I'll try give my thought after I use it.
Vision is awesome problem is the audio microphone shows red line off and cannot unlock until about 3 minutes before meeting. So is it time other end keeps saying it's me to open my microphone can you please help and tell me what am I doing wrong to fix this happens every time every 2 weeks same problem thank you

Satisfactory .
"Time limit I would like to tell my concern regarding on your app, zoom. Since everyone is using this app, can we atleast remove the time limit to every meeting? Instead of 40 mins, make it limitless. I hope you'll consider, thank you!"
Not very steady app
In a starting when I install zoom it was good..but now there is some serious problem. I can't able to hear professor or any other voice..nor they are able to hear my voice.. there is some serious problem in Audio ...all meeting are not audible at all..plz check this is very irritating..

I still think good things about this app. Sept. 3. 2020 I had been experiencing audio problem with zoom. In many of my call lately. Audio is very bad for me. I can't hear anyone.
How do I get a background changed?
"Mainly downloaded to use this app as a zoom participating personal with visual at meetings. However the app while logged in with the group wouldn't get video with me in the group, just listening and watching them. I'm very disappointed!ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¤"
"It's just that it's time period is just 30 mins and the classes we are having during this lockdown of coronavirus,COVID - 19 we need longer periods And while rejoining many are facing problems. But it's a good app for short meetings"
Good

Hello My name is Satyam Bhandari. I have an complaint this app is so frustrating during corona virus our school lectures are held on this zoom app when the zoom class starts after 14 minutes automatically close the zoom application . I checked that the internet connection is good. Next time when I again open the link after 5 or 6 minutes automatically close zoom application . But another settings are good.

"One problem is the unstable connectivity. It keeps buffering for like every minute. It's difficult for me especially in online class, I skipped some lessons and explanation because of it. But still a helpful app."
The wide angle space feature is fascinated to me but sometimes there is network issue in result the video get stuck and the sound reaches little late to other person ...

There is no filters on zoom for Samsung

"I enjoy using Zoom. It has kept my life in tact during the COVID19 pandemic. Easy to contact and stay in touch with family and friends. Our spiritual life is still very rewarding because of Zoom. We can see and fellowship with our spiritual family and friends. This has brought much, happiness, security, and spiritual growth. When my brother died in Georgia (I live in Virginia), it was through Zoom that I was able to be comforted and to comfort other family members and friends. Thank you."
Good most of the time. Though my tablet has been crashing all the time when I run zoom lately. I have to connect with both my phone and tablet so that I don't disappear while teaching.
Ok
Great product. No virtual-background support!!!ðŸ˜¥
"Picture perfect but sound drifts away, otherwise I am giving you four stars."
Good during lock down but I've uninstallsd since then because no one really uses it now after lock down. When I used it though meetings would disconnect after a while which is annoying.
Sometimes is difficult to connect
Nice app for official and mass purpose during covid outbreak
Bueno
Very Good !
Its a good app
First time use. Would like to utilise features next time
it can only allow only 100 participates and because of this many of my classmates couldn't join meeting

I give 4 star because it not contain voice when we share screen then use audio so members can't hear the video voice
Nice app for meetings
Good for online classes but consumes more internet

After updating still camera sharing is not available during meeting.
Super app
Its good but there is no virtual backgound on my phone
it is so expensive app ðŸ˜ƒ
"Well,the app is good at online platform but it requires some fixes"
"The absolute best video conferencing platform I've used. Great Audio, graphics. and connection speed. Great for quick impromptu meetings. Not so user friendly in the beginning huge learning curve for a lot of users"
Bhai jabsa ubdate kara ha tabsa meeting ma chat qolta ha to video band ho jaythi ha
Good but some minor bug's.
Ok
Good
The best meeting app I ever said thank you for that
Best app for meetings and for school lectures too....but I feel that it still needs some improvements because when the host has network problem he gets disconnected while he is disconnected any participants become host and that's one big problem I feel....else it is too good app
It doesn't show my video on and then I am removed from the meeting help @zoom.us
Good
It is fantastic
Valo
Nice
"Useful for online classes,meeting, conferencing and group discussion on topics etc."

I want to rate 4 star because in this lock down it helps to do your atudy easy
Very good app and a best app for short term meetings [if your network speed is fair] the only thing is they should include a feature [captions] the words which the people speak shold be visible
This is so nice app as these app do not contain ads

I should give 5 star but zoom is giving more update
Zoom is a very good app. But the only problem is after the last update of virtual background for Android it is not giving the virtual background option. So please help me with this problem
"App rotates automatically even i have turned off ""autorotate"" in my device. Please fix this bug"
I will give 4 stars because zoom app is excellent in all features but if it will add to record meeting by members also other than host and co host.Then I will give 5 stars. It just needed to add record meeting option for everyone who are in meeting. I hope zoom can do this in next update. Thank You!!!

"All I can say is.... thank you. You have been great. Always strive to improve though, but, as is, you guys really fulfilled my meeting needs. Keep it up! Oh, please make ""screen share sounds"" be an option for all devices. Only worked on a PC and not my tablet."
"Not really bad,I like it"
It is good for the meetings but there is the problem in camera ..... Otherwise I like this app its not perfect but excellent app ...
The app is superb. But the problem is when the host is sharing screen he/she would not know who are in waitig room so can give notification To admit in android

Our schools are not open but then also we can continue our study on zoom but because of updating it is much problems
"It's a cool app. it just sucks when ur connection breaks up and ya miss what ppl have said or are saying. But other than that, I like the zoom app. Kinda wish it had more settings though, to change the display and background and stuff like that. But oh well, it's iiight.. !(: Thanks !"
You have to fix one thing that if we open other things while meeting so our video will not be paused and video will not stop this is a big issue please try to solve it it is a humble request to you
Can't hear participation voice
Nice meeting app but in this app every participant allow to share in the meeting
Nice
It's a really helpful app for students like but there is one problem ðŸ™„ my zoom just doesn't get updated . If this problem was not there then I would have given it a 5 star .
Consuming so much battery and data
Nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
Super experience
Good
Best app for taking online classes but the main thing I dont like is student can't record what their teachers are teaching as well as it does not support virtual background in android phone
Ok
This is good video conferencing app. The user interface is very basic which helps the users to use the app. Sometimes it has issues of low quality video or bad audio quality otherwise it is a good app. I think the 40 min limit for free users should be removed.
It was a good app But need updates for kore Power efficiency and dark mode helped in solving this issue a lot but still Can't do meetings for a long tym on phone Its almost finishing the data and charge.Hope you guys come up with something new.
Good app
In link sharing option we need WhatsApp please ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™

Zoom has been so important during our recent restricted lives

If everyone getting problem with the voice please update the aap and the voice will be clear if you get help with this complement please tap one yes button Thank you
Zoom is a great video conferencing app and it's very valuable in this period of covid. Everything is fantastic. But plz enable virtual background for lower android devices so that all can use this feature. Do fix this.

"Zoom has become a way of life during the 2020 Pandemic. It connects families, coworkers, students &teachers, and new friends around the world. It could be improved by having more technical assistance. I personally had some major problems with audio and unresponsive screens and was not able to connect to anyone who could assist me, answer my questions or give feedback if others had experienced the same problem."

"After updates the app is better but then also , connection goes very frequently even if in good network .Also the voice is not clear sometimes. Please do something."
"Good app for me and my way of doing things. I haven't used it since downloading the new update, but I would believe if there are any issues with it. The developers are already working out the bugs and would be sending out a new update immediately. So for all of you that give the app 1 or 2 stars because the newest version isn't working to your standards(CHILL OUT). And give them a break because they are also in this PANDEMIC with us as well."
Nice app

What on earth was the need of changing zoom? It was fine when we did not close our video and open the participants list and it used to show that our video is open and in the gallery view our video used to freeze but now it is the exact opposite. I just have this complaint rest is brilliant.

Very good app. but be aware of fake companies using this to defraud users.
it's been pretty great it's very confusing when you do it on a computer and it asks you to open the box but then you have the download box when you're already enrolled and that's frustrating I know it's taking some time to switch over to have millions and millions of people use it but for my family it has been the greatest thing on Earth for us through the coronavirus thank you zoom

Majboori mein install kiya tha
Easy to operate and host or join as participant. Handy features to let people chat privately or stop their own video /audio. Easy to mute all participants or share screens.
I've had it before and I do enjoy the App
It's nice to see people my meetings. I do wish I could see more than 4 people on my phone though. This app has improved so much since it started out.
"It is agood app,it enables good vissibility and good audial sound to partispants."

Very encouraging. l'm blessed.
The screen froze several times. Poor sound quality.
One help required is where is virtual background seen in mobile phone and should allow free session for atleast 1 hour to 1 an half an hour time
Nice app
"Please enable screen lock for the users in the meeting because as we know many users across the globe uses touch screen smartphones so sometimes while attending the meeting ,we people uncesscarily press the unmute button.if lock screen lock option will be present in future updates it might avoid."
ZOOM freezes quite a bit; I hate the interruptions.
Very good and clear
Hopefully OK
Good app
"I would love to Give 5 stars but since the update in August my video experience has been awful, every time I go to talk I can't hear anyone, then I mute myself and it is 5 to 10 seconds before I hear anyone again...plus when I talk...it's garbulled or my other zoom friends are. .just terrible to listen to ðŸ™„ðŸ˜ðŸ™„"
It does what I need to it to do. I use it for my business and it has allows me to continue working when I might not have done so in the past. I am very grateful for products like this.

I loved my experiences! I don't have a sim but if you all want to chat or talk with your friends then all you need is to ask for the email/phone number they put to sign up. I am giving this a 4 because many hackers enter the meetings. In order to prevent I put a meeting password but its not working and it would be fun to add new features to it
Nice

"The app works well and it should allow uses to display more than the 4 video tiles while on mobile. On my previous tablet and on my tab s7+, I have a higher resolution than some desktops, yet we can't get a better view."

"It is very good app for School Online Classes. It had good video and camera quality but the virtual background in my Android phone (Vivo V9) is not working and It is working in my another Android phone, Please check this issue and I have sent many reports on this. It is present in IOS and Laptops and more. The new update is amazing. There were only 2 reactions and now there are 6 reactions. The Dark Mode Support is very nice. Sound Quality is also nice. That's Why I rated this app 4 stars."
It's nice app
I like going back to the meetings it was really depressing not seeing my friends anymore leaning on one another learning from one another loving one another helping one another I'm glad I got it back on Zoom

"I am a young student who had never heard of ZOOM before Covid19 and I feel the software is great and helpful for students like me & especially for the teachers. It efficiently enables virtual meetings. Teachers can share their screens, show wonderful videos, share polls and quizzes. The annotation tool helps them to explain a particular chapter that we didn't understand. But I have an issue sometimes in between my classes because of the connectivity issues. Otherwise it is a great software."
Good App for video conferencing
So nice app I loved it
Very good
I will give it 5 stars but i am not getting how to change virtual background according to new update
There is no sound for video while screen sharing
Super

This app is very good for meetings but some time the meeting is started but you can't join that meeting Ye app boht acha hai magar kabhi kabhi ap join nahi karpate hain

It's a good aap but some issues or there like picture frezzes etc.
Very good for online class
Nice app but please enable virtual backroom for android phones and tablets also
Best update but there is no virtual background for Android phone ðŸ“± users. So why I update also but there is no virtual background option in more or in camera. When I update in participate my video showing off but actually it is on .Why this is happening?????
Good
Good app but do one thing creators reduce the amount of data used in live session
It's a nice app for students as this gives a lot of options to our teachers to teach us in different ways.but I think that you should have to make a section for giving test where our teachers can upload out test paper and we would be able to solve it.so you should think of an update with this idea.but the main problem is we are not able to sign in after many attempts even after making a new email if so you should look at the problem and solve it.
Nice app for video conference ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
Super
More improvement are possible
The one and only best app to conduct meetings but virtual background should not only be in laptops but it should be in mobiles and tabs also.
It's nice to use zoom for meeting but when our net is slow it automatically leaves the meeting.

I really like using zoom for virtual meetings and webinars. I don't like how those who create the rooms are allowed to block or disable others video and voice in situations that are not interruptive.
Great
I love this app because its picture quality is very good and 4 stars because sometimes there is so much network problem
There is some problem so please solve it but it is good app

"It wold be better if they had given us a feature of setting time for the meeting, I mean one meeting is of only 40 minutes that's why we have to log in again for the meeting and it is very difficult as there are 5 classes in a day. So it would be more efficient if you add 'set time for the meeting' feature. BTW It's a very good app for meetings."
Sound is very low in meeting
It's very good
Good
Please can keep the rejoin or reconnect option in zoom meeting
Good
Nice
Plz help to record classes

Recently with the new update. Started facing problem and even I heard same from my colleagues. It keeps on popping a dialog box saying to check internet connection and firewall. My internet is working perfectly fine and I can access other meeting apps smoothly. And I don't have any firewall on. I am operating on Jio network provider in India. But suspicious about them(Jio network) also. But can't say why they would not want zoom to work on their network. Kidnly find a fix immediately. Thanks.
Good app for online class ... Would be nice if there was a player in player mode
It needs to improve.... Background option in android
Good app
App is betterðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ to conduct schools Meeting. There are many ner fiture like good ðŸ“· Camera ðŸ“· and but only thing which made this app 4 starts than 5 start is that it requires strong internet ðŸ˜ðŸ˜that only the problem if zoom works on it i will give zoom as 5 rating then to better app
Please give video share and virtual background for even mobiles Even you give it not in our apps Please solve this problem for our students
"The zoom is a very good app for meetings. But as the complaints of the costumers, there are too sound problems. But when we update zoom, it has a clear voice. So I am telling to those who have sound problems, please update zoom and then see the voice. I am not taking the gareenti of it, if the sound problems are continuous, then I think you must have some network problems. Because updated zoom has no sound problems at all. I think the best part is we can also take a meeting there with our friend"
It is conzuming more net
It is a excellent app
Glood
"Now, i will change my review, you are solving glitches and you are adding new features. I loved your work."

Very nice app. But have some network issues many times and usually whenever host is speaking something her/his voice is not clear...... Pls take care about it.... And the most important thing we have to update this app again and again it is irritating.. Pls update it only at once do not update again and again.. Thanks

Gjb
This App is good but this app take update all day .
Good app
It is good but followed by a number of demerits at times . Sometimes audio quality is poor that we are not able to hear anything and sometimes video quality is bad so the other person is not able to see us.And at times it works awesome ya it's screen sharing is good .But they should provide some features for attendance that will be good and some more features should be included in this app to make it a all time awesome app. Some big fixes should be there . Overall I suggest this app for meeting.
So nice app . Ib the app there are so many capacity.
This is good app for attaining the class regularly. We can easily communicate with our teacher and friends.
My school lekcher is here its me use this app this app is verri nice app i like it

I use zoom daily for school and it works great but unfortunately with the last update my camera is appearing super dark. I have adjusted my brightness and took my device off of dark mode and restarted multiple times but nothing is helping. Please fix. Thank you

Super experience
Very very useful to listen for class
Great platform. Free platform not HIPAA compliant. LImiting the meeting time is the reason I deleted it. When there are so many other platforms to use why use this one when the time limits terminate the session and it's costly.
Very G
Good
Connection drops regularly
Love the app but one suggestion when signed in to zoom account there should be meeting history sync i don't like that we have to enter meeting ID even if I am signed with the same so account and some network issues need to be fixed
"Hello I have been using Zoom for my online classes and it had helped me a lot. But still I have something to say, can't you just add a option of edit profile!!!

"Please can record, edit and share streams meetings live online."
"Actually this app is great and very useful. My ultimate problem in this app is that its so hard to activate either create an account. Instead of creating your account fast for your online class its much harder that what you thought. So i hope next time it wont take time too long like the other apps. Thats it, but still good."

Mi son loves to attend classes
"Good, I want you to add the features like together view and poll even in basic zoom as well. similarly, this apps need third party browsers to open also. If you want compete with other domains, you must come with all the features like Google or Microsoft office. at least some important features to be incorporate with zoom basic also or give features available for poor and developing countries. you must go to market n such a way so that you can defeat all other domain thank you. with regards."

"Zoom is the best app for meeting. Coz there are many features, which is not present in another apps like google meet. Some features are listed below : â€¢Virtual raise hand : Zoom allows you to raise your hand virtually coz of which the meeting will not be disturbed and the host will easily know you want to say something. â€¢Mute : Zoom allows the host to mute everybody and nobody will be able to unmute until the host unmutes. â€¢Private chat : Zoom allows everybody to chat privately."

"Hi Zoom Team, this application is amazing and works very well in all devices but I would personally love it if the next update gives the people who use phones and tablets to access the gallery view and the chat and participation section in one screen just like the ones in PC. For it takes a long time to go to the chat section in phone or tablet. The video freezes and it becomes hard for the people to understand that I am in the chat. Thank you"

The inconsistency is becoming normal. How can I gain access to my meeting yesterday and just 12hours later am denied access for all important function and I paid heavily for this platform to enable me do my business without hitches now everything is in Shambles. Please engineers should fix this issue because it's a far cry.
