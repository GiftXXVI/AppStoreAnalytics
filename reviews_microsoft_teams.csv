"I even don't want to give it one star but it compulsory for writing comment.. Oh my God it is the most worst app, I have used till now.ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ How many password it requires ðŸ˜ . It is not signing me, and tomorrow is my mid-term final exam, How will I doðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«"
Tere nmbje se lockdown me bhi pdhai karni pdhti heðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Sing problem
"Very bad, it's pop-up automaticly on my screen phone after swap off the application it will be appear again on 1 - 3 min later.. it's make me very annoying."
This is really really so bad app ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ if you. Try once you will surely delete this app
It automatically refresh every 2-3 seconds. Just make me angry ðŸ˜ 
Bore app
this is trash like ms companyðŸ˜• not working in androideðŸ˜ˆ
Awful
This aap is very bad for online classes
I should not give 1 star it is rubbish
My sign in using my company account is suddenly discontinued! Even though other MS products are working perfectly..
I hate
App keeps on trying to start even though I have logged out. It is getting so annoying I'm having to uninstall it
"It's a good app. However, because of the fact that EVERY time I open it I have to go through some kind of anoying feature pages, I cannot give it more than 1 star. @Microsoft do something about it!"
Eww school lol
Bad
Good guess
"My company switched from Slack to Teams, and the Teams app won't work unless I install Workspace One and hand over control of my phone to my employer. That's a big fat NOPE. Also, Teams in the browser regularly makes my laptop freeze, and it's overall just infuriating to use. MS, your product is bad, and you should feel bad for inflicting it on the world."
Worst meeting app ever
School sucks :p
"The app on PC is awesome, but the mobile app is the worst option among Hangouts, Zoom or even Discord. Notifications do not work all the times and chats sometimes even just sync after an app restart."
it's horrible
New versiÃ³n doesn't allow full screen :(
"It will not open, i just keep gettig a popup saying that it keeps stopping!"
Not useful for me
"Slow, kicks me out, has REALLY bad problems. If this wasn't here I would be happy this is a horrible app to use!!! It's garbage doesn't even let me send anything is super slow this app sucks!!! I don't recommend."
Do not update this app because i am tying update this app lots off time still it is not update.
Not at all a user friendly app. The problem is that it never seems easy to use if my online classes were not taking place at this app then I would've never used it . It shows slow connection detected even when the speed is around 15Mbps and the call gets drop suddenly and then I am unable to reconnect and then I have to go to browser even then also not able to connect. After the update not able to see recorded lecture on the app . Why the hell do you update it if it's only going to be worse .
I have been trying to down load this on my phone for the last 45 minutes sondo not rate it one bit
Not user friendly. I just wanted to join a meeting but it asks me to create my own team. I dont need to. I just nneded to join a meeting.
for calling zoom is better teams sucks I hate teams
I can't sign in. It won't send me my code to my phone. I have tried for days. I am getting absolutely annoyed.
I hate school
This is a good app.I like it. Thank you For making this app. Once again Thank you so much.
BECAUSE every time I download it a have to download it again on a link of my classes
No option to create a test call on mobile.
Worst app
"Cannot receive incoming calls on mobile. Apparently, according to Technet, this has been ongoing for about 2 years with no fix. Garbage."
"Screen sharing is not working properly. When a person shares his screen from laptop , screen views as distorted . Im using redmi note 7 pro"
This is poor aap zoom is better
Horrible
Horrible
"Teams is getting hanged evry time now..my device is LG Q6+ after my call even i click on hanging up, it not getting hanging up and app is get stucked and hanged ..worst it is"
"You all are such idiot, dont make any app in your life. In mobile it says that varify from your mobile how can it be done if already using by mobile. Same is going on in laptop, why have all of you made change and added the mobile varification Why the hell i should download it on my mobile while i am using it on laptop."
This is lol app
Terrible!
This app take so much battery and mobile data. When i was taking my today class at 40% battery after 10 minutes it takes 25% battery
Very hard application
I can't sign in on mobile
Not as expected
Last update seems to have caused a lot of performance issues. Switching between windows while in a call now causes the app to black screen at each transition now. It seems to be specific to when running in picture in picture mode
If we have 0 star I am give you it very bakare app

"Teams used to be good and reliable but now because of the new update I always have to refresh teams,close it,open it and refresh again to let someone to see my posts or to see my own posts or someone else's posts and it is really annoying and the calls don't connect easily and the servers crash regularly. Now teams is not the best app to do work on so I am sorry but please fix it Microsoft teams,thank you"
This application causes major problems to enterprise user. Just joined call with android phone. No voice. Not from phone speaker. Not from any source. Totally horrible app. Leaved call again. No change. Leaved again logged out and back in. Not able to join call join button not vissible. Totally nightmare. Also in pc uses easilt 50% 1.5-2gb cpu when no calls and just some chats open. Totally broken solution.
It will not install onto my device.
Its so slow its annoying really!!!
"Such a useless app ,i hve tried to sign in 100s of times but it hadn't,hate this app too much"
"Stupid app, always crashing"

"I have not encountered any app more pathetic than MS Teams which if full of bugs. -The interface is not at all Intuitive. - Audio does not work even after unmute 95% of the time. And 5% of the time surprisingly works. There is no feedback as to why this is happening. -taking a screenshot, it would throw permission issues.. but again it would allow with no changes done to the settings. - Calendar function is pathetic. U have to open through links. Many more.. bt word limit prohibits."

"1-Oct: 1- The App is still Super Slow. 2- Desktop version of Teams is too heavy and sucks up all resources, making Desktop very slow. 4-Jun: This seems to be a great App but: 1- It's too slow both on Mobile and Desktop. 2- Notifications are bit late. 4- If are part of multiple teams it's really difficult to identify which all are new message. 5- No notifications if any file is uploaded or existing one modified."

L Ok I'll stop saying I have a few days off
Worst app ever. So much difficulty signing in whether with the phone number or email. Finally joined as a guest late to my class and can't use the chat feature . I hope I never have to use it again after this semester. Terrible performance.
I am a student and I can't watch my recorded classes on teams and when I downloaded that ms streams even then some classes were unavailable and that is for all the students of my class . If I could give zero stars I would give zero stars
Its open over other apps multiple times by its own. Too irritating!
Baler app. Maki cgud. Baler baler dhauear
Its very difficult app... compare by Zoom app
It takes soooo much space
"Im a highschool student, i was almost wasnt able to enter my class. My teacher stated that i had to write my full name. I checked the settings and my real name was there. But there wasnt any edit name button. For my teachers screen my real name isnt displayed. Is this a glitch? Please fix it."
Recorded videos are not available
It is not even worth of one star. Files take a lot of time to upload. Teams is crashing on my phone from some days..it's really annoying when you are attending classes.
The worst in the world
I can't login. I keeps telling me that something is wrong with my internet connection and i should try again. And i do.
Saying it stopped need to be batter
"As a teacher I cant access to many features, for example, I cant open the returned asssignments in my cellphone."

"I am using a personal account in browser because your app is not working then i sign out and log back in and it says I'm not on teams. Please create one. So i created one and i can't get back to the meeting I am joining. And your application really sucks. It does not sync in the browser and Android app. It's all empty. Then, whenever I'm joining a meeting link it always show ""seems like you're entering a meeting you ar not part of."""

Kindly put the together mode and blur background option in every device. And then I will give â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† to the app

Very worst app. It uses lots of data. Full of lag and bugs. Sometimes it automatically sign out and asks ID and password. When I tries to mute my mic it doesn't mute. There is no option for controlling data usage. Image quality is very poor. Don't download this. I only downloaded this for my online classes and teachers told to download this. Students gave complaint to change platform for classes but they haven't changed it yet. Worst app.
I hate this app bc I don't like teachers
I'm not getting any notifications after the classes are started and when they make us attendees we can't invite other . This app is no more flexible as it used to be

"As far as the app goes, it crud. I can't access it stating I need to have an email to enter. I look for the email everywhere I can that is related to the information that I provided them to find there is nothing. I tried to uninstall and reinstall with the same issue. The additional part of it that doesn't let me in is the group will let me in when they want me. I question who is this group they talk about? The Microsoft website is the only possible way I can access my account. I hope they fix this issue, it would be great to get in by the app."
Not even working well
"When i am trying to signing in in my note 8 pro, it is keep showing me error that check your connection. Even when i am connceted to the wifi with 100 mbps speed"

"I use this because I have to for work. Recently, it started randomly taking over my phone and cycling. Open, close, open, close. The only way to get temporary control of my phone back was to restart my phone. I wasn't using the app at the time. It appears this was an attempt to force me to log in but it wouldn't stay open long enough for me to do so. I've refreshed my login creds now and we'll see if it stays fixed. That being said, it shouldn't take over my phone when I'm not using it."

"Inadequate ! Everytime I try turning in my assignments, it takes a couple of minutes to finish up loading. Furthermore, when utilizing my phone while attending live sessions, it makes my phone glitchy and sluggish. MS teams was I great app. Frankly, I was loving this app but this app eventually went substandard. Please fix this app and the current issues and complications we've encountered while utilizing this app."
I am disappointed with you Microsoft. While in a meeting and you chat you just can't do it especially in laptops. It takes so much of time to just write a sentence as it just lags too much. And yeah it takes time to even upload that message. This doesn't happen everyday but it happens very often with me and with others whom I talk to. When this happens it will take you a fortune to unmute and mute your mic.I checked my WiFi and it is perfect. I used YouTube Google everything was working perfect.
Voice is not comming from the headphones and earphones
It's bad for students ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I use to learn classes on school in this teams . It will drag all network
I hate it vibrating everytime I react to someone's chat/reply even tho I already disabled the vibration from my settings and to this app settings. Will you please remove that.

"I've been trying for five hours, but haven't downloaded"
"I've have searched the internet hight and low, I've updated my version of Teams and still cannot change my profile picture. Basic beta apps allow you to change your picture. Every article says click ""edit profile"" ""change picture"" etc. These buttons don't exist anywhere on my desk top Teams or on mobile. If there is a reason, the Microsoft help section should state that clearly. On the desktop version there is no way to send a picture in chat. Again, articles say ""click the paperclip"", not paperclip exists. Thankfully at least the mobile version allows it, but it's too time consuming to email a picture to myself, open the email on my phone and then go into Teams mobile to send a simple picture. The whole set up of this app isn't intuitive or easy. If it wasn't for work, would never use again."
I can not go to my assignment from my android phone at all..already unistall and install it back but still code error.please fix this.
"Ini kenapa lagi? Tulisannya ""Sorry, but we're having trouble with signing you ini""."
Faaltu app hai dont download it
"Just a replica of discord, lol."

Hay mucho problemas con los servidores
Horrible Had all my information from my teacher and from my laptop and it said it was wrong. Do not download this is a waste of storage.
It always lags and comes teams has stopped worst app ever
Transient error. Whatever that means.
School sucks
It keeps signing me out and then when I get a message it wont let me text the person back.
"Doesn't work it says I'm not connected to the network and I tried 10,000 times and our router is fine"
Hate it y'all made me go to online class ðŸ™„âœ‹
Why I give it a 1 because teams keep saying that couldn't sign you in :(
It would get 5 but now when i try to login the app is not working and is giving me an error code
"Always crashing, always with a white screen of dead. I have to go back to my computer to use it."
Trash app. So many sad paths it's quite unstable.
Trashhhhh
It's not letting me log in or anything I think there's some fixing too do that's for sure
Aplicacion basura ni se conecta a las videollamadas
One of the worst apps. It's surprisingly worse than the desktop version which is pretty terrible too. Always does something weird and text input is delayed so you think your keyboard didn't register but it's just the app.
Crashing when tried to click and share image in chat
"Won't auth anymore, or at least not consistently."
Won't auth most the time. Pretty hit and miss!
Very problematic. I can't even sign in at the moment.
"This application sucks, it's always glitchy, it never works and I always have to uninstall it to work, good job microsoft on creating the worst app"
I hate it
"Constant bugs, saying ""too many requests"" even if you aren't doing anything"
Couldn't login and lag alot
I keep getting the following error while using the app. Restarting the app also doesn't fix the issue Message: AADSTS90033: A transient error has occurred. Please try again.
Always having issues while logging in
"I have never been able to get it to work, what a POS!!!"
"Seriously would think this app was designed for iphone... Maybe it was. But the Microsoft desktop version isn't a whole lot better. If my company hadn't decided to use this before I joined them I wouldn't be using it now. Sometimes the app will just flash like the screen flashes, I thought there was something wrong with the phone the first time a saw it. Now it keeps kicking me out saying it's having trouble logging me in, but if I go back there it is just fine (for ten seconds or so)"
"Stopped working and kept pulling up a blank window that just says Teams and didn't allow me to do anything else, tried to uninstall and reinstall and now it just keeps saying ""AADSTS90033: A transient error has occurred. Please try again."" And refuses to let me sign in"

Great and easy to use App with so many functions ðŸ‘. I can't sign into this App anymore even after updating. Pls help
"Useless. Sign in take long time, time expired, or exceed max try. What the hell of it ! This is not my problem. I entered everything correctly and said access denied. What the Hell is this, i just created this 5 min ago and tell me there are too many attempt. I only try log in twice only. Why make life so difficult."
"This is like every other Microsoft product I've used. It's slow, buggy, and infuriating with plenty of other options that work much better. If my organization didn't use it, I certainly wouldn't choose it. Even creating an account and logging in was a hassle with menu loops and error messages. Microsoft is best at making inferior copies of the work and great ideas of others."
Its very bad
Yes Microsoft app thanks so much I really want to go out for lunch and I only go up to my room to go to go to go to my room and my room
It conflicts with my phone. Every time while sending a picture or changing the audio source the phone gets stuck!
Your app is useless.because I set me password they said the password is wrong. I set new password but they said incorrect
Awful app
ask me to login everytime and it continuously restarts.

App worked for two weeks until Friday. Now receive login error. Deleted app and re-installed still receiving same error. Login works for all other Office 365 products. No support on the issue either.
When I get in my laptop to do my school stuff it bugs out and says sorry we couldn't sign into youre account and I put my password and I did every thing but still does same thingðŸ˜”
I already wrote review.. It is lost. The app after update will not lwt me open it. It keeps asking to go to playstore.
More than anyother meeting apps teams consume more battery usage ðŸ˜¡
The new version in which participants have to wait in lobby is very annoying and time consuming for educational purposes .So please remove this feature.
Microsoft teams the recorded videos are not playing or downloading on my laptop... Very bad app...pathetic....
The screen is glaring damn ! Worst app ever. Because of this I can't understand properly me ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
It's bad appp You download this app it means waste youvdata
Should make it better
Very bad
Why are you not sending me password

The new update is worse . The whole new waiting system has caused me to not able to attend 2-3 classes. Just please remove this feature
"Worst app ever, doesn't perform even 10% of its desktop version functions, hangs, unble to show whole conversation of the Team meetings"
"Rubbish! Can't even activate account, getting problems with signing in error and thats it.... waste of time"
"The chat is not working properly during meeting. As I have lectures on or and chat part is important but the chat daily hangs. Pls, solve this issue and after that I will give it 5 star rating. Else this is best app for schools colleges and coachings lectures. Also bring option of background change on mobile app also as on desktop it is there"
Bad because online classes
I don't know why people are saying this app is easy to use and it's well organized. Nothing is organised and it's difficult to use because there's so many unnecessary things to click on. WhatsApp is better than this. I feel like this app should be simplified.
Always lagging.. and I can't see the activities...
Nice
Not a good app for meeting purpose Feeling very bad about this cause I can't able to send a message during the meeting ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž
This app is trash!

It is so much confusing app that I can't study my online class. My friend also have issuses. In one month it has 20 network issues. I can't complete my revisions as the test is coming. Before this my school teaches classes on WhatsApp. It was better than this. If I was in school I never study or I never talk with my friends on this app. It takes very net and do not function properly. I think this app should be more improved. Anyways I dislike it very very very much. Please improve this app. ðŸ‘Ž.
ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘

App is very heavy
Worst Automatically get disconnected and then it's impossible to rejoin. I missed many classes due to this reason. Voice quality is worst. video quality bad to worst. Slow to upload comments and doesn't provides latest update s about classes. I am disappointed.
"Pinche aplicaciÃ³n culera, mil horas trada para subir un archivo de 1 Mega, nunca manda notificaciones de las reuniones a tiempo, la interfaz se tarda muchÃ­simo x no notifica las tareas pendientes. Nada mÃ¡s porque la universidad tiene convenio sino ni la usaba."

"I use this app for college studies on my phone. Firstly, when we join the meeting app does not provide the feature for full screen. Secondly, it does not provide option for private recording the meeting. Thirdly, it started to lag when we use different feature. Fourthly, it should provide a lock option on "" Take Control "" to provide from misuse."

Difficult transition from Outlook. ... Structure of files confuse users. ... Non-optimal online meeting experience hinders adoption. ... Challenges regarding permission settings. ... Limited flexibility can lead to manual replications

BEKAR APP HAI.... NIHAAYTI
There are lot of issues with this app. After join the class with name it's still showing unknown user. Sometimes I can't hear the voice and for sometime I can't see the slide. In the notification it's showing I'm in the class but in the aap I'm still waiting. There are lot of bugs. After clearing the notification it opens the app and that's irritating.
Why contact permission for work account?
So slowly
Please add some more features
Bakar
There is not any background in Mobile
Worst app for online classes bcz the teacher are being removed by students and it distrubs the class and also the video quality is more worst bcz I am attending the class with WiFi router and in the room where it Is installed so u guys can understand that the signal will be excellent but then also the video quality is sooo much blur.
I am unable to toggle (from the very moment onwards when I updated the app recently) between apps while I am present in the meeting.... If I try toggling between apps the meeting freezes and I will not be able to unmute or share my screen...until I end the call.
Its Decreasing my Phone Battery Capacity Fastly and the app is very slow to connect with Mobile Data. So the app is not much usefull to the people
Very bad app does not let me enter meetings and does not show messages
West
Baddest meeting app I am a student and I am trying to log in from 9 days but it is not log in ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ I am too much angry about that if we don't want to sign in why are you forcing us for that. That use notification for varification is of no use. Please update this.
What a waste app always asks loginðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
"A lot of problem are there in the app. Very slow and many times when calls come, we do not get ring tone for the call. Many times incoming messages notifications do not load. Call noise cancellation is very bad. Hope Microsoft will solve the existing bugs in teams android and web versions!"

"The app is good but signing by a organization is trouble maker, on this point condition is worst ðŸ‘Ž"
i cannot get past login. thereafter nothing

Worst app doesn't work at all
I don't like this app because this app only my teachers are teaching
"Worst app. In an attempt to provide more and more functions simplicity of the app is lost. Following messages are common scenario of the app Wrong user ID, then wrong password, And the most worst thing is that User have no authority to reset the passwordðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"

"Sad to say, it is utter garbage. The UI is too clunky and the notifications are not removed even after checking updates. Old calls are still not removed. Chats that are hidden cannot be seen again. The app has become unusable and the screen keeps loading itself repeatedly."
It's just another pain
Slow
In Android doesn't have access to saved video and it's very bad
I keep on clicking shin in and I had an account on my old phone and it froze my account if there was zero star I would rate it that ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

"I hate this app! If work wasn't making me use it, I'd burn it. Scrolling up is like running on a treadmill, see the same posts all the time! Searching is hit and miss. You may get some recent ones if you're lucky! It cuts off at maybe 10 posts. Great function, cheers! ðŸ™„ Updates sometimes allows you to post pictures, sometimes squares and then to see photos need to send in replies. You got rid of predictive tags so now have to use @, which when tagging multiple parties annoying."

This app hangs many times.

Keeps opening random tab
Soooo many things are broken. Not worth your time. Sucks when you are forced to use this because of your job's requirements.

Its used for school
Keeps closing sort it out
This is very good app but few days there was some prblm in this it not send any files and some times it not give me any response
The app is sluggish
Not too good but this app often freezes and the screen sharing cannot be visible properly . During slow internet connectivity it totally stops working and then it's a huge problem fixing it . Often while the meeting is going on many people get removed from the meeting and thus it gets impossible to rejoin . Expected a little good response from Microsoft .
Ghatiya app .Is app ki wajah se jabardasti online classes attend karni padti hai . Self study to karr hi nahi paate. Please don't install this app . Worst thing of Microsoft. Bill gates tumse se ummeed nahi thi. Are iss accha to whatsapp me padh Loo. Itna accha chal raha tha aur ye corona aur teams ne zindagi barbaad kar dii. Shame on you teams banane waalo. Zindagi barbaad kar dii is app ne. Khoob sara data khata hai ye app. Are yaar itna pareshan hoo online classes se ki kya batau.Ghatiya app.
I do not like this app because it glitches all the time and takes ages to upload assignment ( and that's how the teachers make us do homework )
This app is very useful for my online classes no problems
I hate this app all it dose is crash
There are many bugs which should be removed from the app.i am facing too many problems while using this app Really dissapointing from an app created by such a reputed company
"Hey teams , I found a very big problem in your app When we download Xbox app and then signin with microsoft account in x box app Then when we go to teams the microsoft team doesnot show any other meeting in calander And this bug mark me absent in meeting for 5 days ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
"Using the phone on my Android is a horrible experience. Dropped calls, can't access voicemail."
"The worst garbage when it comes to team chats. Couldn't be more convoluted to set up, somehow it changes my email address's user name??, and quality? Garbage. Just plain garbage. If nhs wasn't forcing this down my throat I would have never bothered with it"
"I don't know why anyone would give this app more than a 1. I've used Google Hangout, Facebook room, and Zoom which are all far superior to Microsoft teams. I'm only using this because my district is forcing me to do so, but I would never willing use this terrible app."
Es duena pero me dan mucho trabajo

I CHANGED MY DP BUT NO ONE WAS ABLE TO SEE MY DP (PHOTO)ISTEAD OF ME PLEASE FIX IT

Everything is fine till it says Teams keeps stopping
"I have a lecture now, and every time I try to download the application, it fails and it writes to me. You cannot download the application, I hope for a solution as soon as possible"
It's garbage
Its use very boaring
"I have a lecture now, and every time I try to download the application, it fails and it writes to me. You cannot download the application, I hope for a solution as soon as possible"
"i cant erase the chat history, activity etc..you can only hide it.."

Absolutely terrible with dealing with multiple gets stuck in a loop if you click on a account you don't have any more or don't want to login to and there is no way to change to another account. Very infuriating.
All in 1 platform makes difficult to identify files compared to Google classroom.
Difficult to use. Hard to understand

"The app doesn't sync with the desktop version. I can be using the desktop version all week, then check the mobile app at the weekend and see ""new"" activity which happened at the beginning of the week. It's also terribly slow to log out so I can then manually re-sync."
Boring...onecgain boring
The app keeps closing as soon as someone shares their screen and there has been no improvement in this evn after giving feedback multiple times.
Video show nahi karta hai
"DO NOT USE THIS APP. This is the worst app I've ever used. Do not use this app at all. I used it for my online classes and this was the worst app, no one had any network issues or anything yet no one could connect to the class. I didn't even want to give this app even 1 star."
This app doesn't contain sufficient net speed.. online classes video lagging issue. I will request to this app maker or particular this server that please do something for this network lagging issue in this app. Huge lagging issue
Closes on open straight away. Rather useless...

Has so many glitches
i am not able to sign in please do not install
Bevri problemaaq
It is a good app but the reason is that in some organisation it doesn't allow to change password of our account this is insecure as many people log in through my account and create a serious problems and i'm blamed for that. My advice is that the permission of changing personal password should be given to people of any type of organization cause many organisations put simple passwords that are easy to crack and attendees login via someone else's account and create problems.

Trash
Your video is automatically zoomed when you join a meeting through this mobile app. It is quite dangerous while attending important calls because in the self view the video appears normal but other people see your zoomed view in their systems. I had a terrible experience while attending my office meeting today. It appeared as if I had intentionally zoomed in the wrong body part during the meeting. I was shocked when a colleague shared a screenshot from his laptop.
Lousy
Lets be honset we dont want schoolðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ‘ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘
Giving one start to grab attention of Tech Team. The app makes the screen completely black when call is in progress. I think this is because of proximity sensor but problem is even if you hold mobile far from your face then also screen remains blacked out. I have to press phone lock screen button and then unlock to fix the black screen issue. This is happening in OnePlus 7.
Not working on my phone since I tried so many ways

"Once two accounts are added in teams, it starts behaving weird, will log out automatically, go blank, not respond, do not connect calls etc etc. After that even if you remove one of the account it keeps behaving same always and forever even after uninstalling and installing again..

It was doing well until the update just made whole screen turn black and made my phone not function have to remove the battery.
"Just a heads up for you people. Take into consideration that when you create a Microsoft Teams account, you won't be able to delete it if you ever change your mind. The only way to deactivate your Microsoft teams account is by deleting your Microsoft account. That means you're going to lose every Microsoft products that you're using, such as Outlook etc. That's what they said to me from Microsoft support."
"I'm not sure why the down load on this chromebook is so aweful, but its nothing like the original teams app I have on my laptop. It's vague, empty and cold looking. You can't access all things from one page, and it feels like things are missing, and its awkward to find the things it does have. One day in and I want to delete it from my daughters computer. If its the Chromebook's fault I appologize, but in that case, do not use this with a chromebook, its a garbage set up."
Ù„Ø£Ù†Ù‡ ÙŠØ¹Ù„Ù‚ Ù…Ø¹ÙŠ Ù…ÙŠØ¯Ø®Ù„ÙŠ

"I need the channel meet now feature on phone too. Otherwise, its kinda okay. A lot of missing features from the desktop version can be added though."
"Microsoft has developed a tool which gives no guarantee that it will sign in again once you sign out. Writing this review after getting frustrated. No Matter what I do, everytime I get error"" we are sorry, we have run into an issue"". Lots of other issues like status remains offline all the time. Now I am feeling I am sorry for choosing this tool. BIG BIG disappointment from Microsoft. Please withdraw this tool from the market. Desktop version is full of bugs. Just refusing to sign in."
Very bad not even one star very bad experince
SUPER MICROSOFT TEAM
i have a chromebook and every thursday i sign onto the SAME meeting. when i use the meeting link sent to me every week it is virtually impossible to join a meeting through the google play application... when i click the link in my email it opens my web browswer and gets me into the meeting that way. all i know is that if i have a windows PC that this wouldnt be happening.this is absoloutly ridiculous and upsetting. zoom is easier.
Keeps on freezing and my class keeps on getting disconnected. Tried reinstalling more than 10 times.. no luck. (Phone.. galaxy j4+)
"Using as an employee Install Edge browser to open excel, maps etc.pushing it too much, far too annoying I start a call on my laptopt and get a notification on my phone to join it ðŸ™ƒ too many stupid bugs like that that make the experiece really poor"
"After update, the apps always force close, freeze and wont let me get into the apps.. thanks bcs of it, I can't do my homework"
Screen share is not good please do something about these ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
Initially I forgot adding my phone number and mail id because I logged in through the college id which was given but now I couldn't able to add my phone number and mail id.... Wat to do for this ?

My assignments are not opening and when they open I am not able to view the work I handed in. It's really difficult for me to work cause of this Please tell the solution for this.
I believe in Microsoft and their developers but today when I was sharing my screen and presenting a model in fusion 360 the screen on the viewers end froze . This was a very important presentation and I am very disappointed . I could not complete my presentation.
Very bad app.Converts large amount of data.
After the new update when you click back the screen turns black and you can not click anything
When I used its old version first time its not too goodðŸ˜§ & I will be late for my online classes but after update this app and the coming of new version make it vry easy to control ðŸ˜€. Now I log in my class at proper time . But from some days it hangged ðŸ˜§ and not as good as I thought ðŸ˜•. After all I give only 1 feedback to this app ðŸ˜®. I hope u make this app more convenient. ðŸ˜•and vry useful .ðŸ˜”
So difficulty
Stuck on switching accounts.
"It was a great app, but now it often gets hanged. Its Assignments option need some modifications, as sometimes the answer get switched. This might be a glitch in the app, or the app is too sensitive. Recently, after the update, its performance has degraded. Meetings don't show up in my calender, teams just disappear, all the files get removed. Please rectify it.. sorry for giving one star review, it deserves at least 4 stars, but I wanted the staff to read this review. Pls sort this out..."
Ø§Ø±ÙŠØ¯ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¯Ø±Ø³Ù‡ Ø­Ø¶ÙˆØ±ÙŠ
It has some technical issues and for uses this app is hard
"This app has so many technical issues, I am just confused why it is assigned to all the students. When we change dp many times, it shows recent pics to all different people. I am a student and one night I was trying many pictures to get one of the best and few days later, one of my friend saw a different one while other the different pic and many more, my professors were seeing another one. Please remove that issue, Correction (remove please word) because it's a mistake to be corrected."
the interface is garbage and poorly optimised
So trashðŸ˜‚Finding the right call or the booking secrion or the eight chat is so confusing. Nothing is in a consistently placed area

I think it's a good app but I honestly despise whoever made it because my teachers have never given my so much work. I swear I'm getting more work when I'm off school than when I'm in school because of this app. I haven't slept in 2 weeks... I'm so tired...
This app destroyed my whole lockdown i don 't recommend you to install this app
"I set notification policy to ""only when inactive on desktop"". EVERY TIME this is updated it is set back to ""always"" mode. But ok, this is from Microsoft. It is not like I have high expectations about SW quality here."

I hated it Cock
"I'm recently forced to use it, but can't join meetings without creati g accounts. At least on Linux. It also had bugs with registration using phone only. I was stuck on a page with no message what was broken."
"I am not able to, shift the account"

This app makes your battery drain and uses more data very unhelpful app please don't use it
When I update this app. I cannot join the meeting. When I join they say 'we cannot compleate the call'
Keep losing connection
Worst app
"Worst app . Though it consumes very less data for meeting it suddenly ends the meeting.No video quality, audio quality. And also it worst than the worst"
I want better. this is not good.
Kill me
mala.
1)Thi app does not allow bluetooth headphone to get connected while call is in progress. No such problem with whatsapp call. 2)While on speaker during call other party cannot hear me. No such problem with whatsapp or zoom call. Using OnePlus 6 and OnePlus bullets 2
It's not ok
Very bad... Not working

"I have missed a lot of my classes because of this stupid app. When i open the team, many times even when the meeting is going on it doesn't show it. 0 stars"
There is no search per personal chat. The chat delay so much. Bug on notification too. Overall really bad. I change it from 3 stars into 1 star. Its just a matter of time everybody will jump off from this ship to another app.
"I am giving. One star for my issue , not able to refresh my posta , only 4-5 post can be seen in post section of a team , I can't see old posts."
This app will hang your device
Not proper working
It's the worst app I've ever seen the person who mack I hate you
"Everything was working just fine until before 2 days. Idk what happened but I am unable to speak in the meeting. I can hear them all but they can't. So annoying when you are present in the class and still when the teacher calls your name, you can't reply hence she marks you absent. Its happened thrice now. Plz do something asap. Also the incoming video is not good at all. I just see blurred images, 8n jumps."
The app is the worst app in the world
Meetings keep on crashing on Xiaomi phones. Please rectify this asap.
Not so good like zoom

Worst app not there chating option

"I dont want to give even one star very worse app i dont know why Microsoft is successful this app has many bugs it dont upgrade or malbehave worse app ever. Idiotic stupid app. It sometimes shows as you are no longer a participant too, and because of this sometimes we can't find our team and sometimes we can't chat.ðŸ˜ "
i have to uninstall & reinstall everytime if i wanna access the meeting
"Such a worst software from Microsoft. Comparing this with google meet and zoom this is absolute non-sense. Since my college have a tie up with Microsoft, we are forced to use this. Really a poor platform from a top notch company like Microsoft. Main reason : Poor live sharing and video performance, a lag will be there always, even if your connectivity is strong. Feeling pitty on this platform. And never ever recomend this for any institution/individuals, they are going to suffer."

Bluetooth audio is not working
Online classes ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Useless if you live in a mobile black spot
The app crashes again and again.
Very poor
Buggie all of the sudden not able to send messages
Connecting to a bluetooth device during a call does not work. Requires multiple restarts. I've tried connecting 5 different bluetooth headsets and the issue persists.
Never worked
"If only it was more stable and less of a resource hog. Well, and less buggy."
"This app is pretty trash, my messages hardly ever send or come in. I'll hear my laptop ping from the next room and check my phone and nothing. Refresh. Quit the app. Open. Refresh and try again. Nothing. What's the point if you don't do any of your functionality well?"
Useless I signed up yet couldn't sign in on android
"Frustrating! I have 2 accounts at my university, 1 as a student, 1 as staff. No matter how many times I try, uninstall, sign out... it will not let me log into my staff account. Every time I log in w staff account, I am brought to the student account teams. Unbelievably aggravating"
Terrible
No one could access the call
Horrible. Too much lag and just hard to use. Instructions not very clear. My uncle John tried to fix it but got distracted making cheese on toast but hey it was very tastyðŸ‘Œ
Extremely batter draining
"Awful like other microsoft products. If it's possible, I give zero stars!"
Everytime I'm trying to go on another place during a call it blacks out my screen at random intervals.
New update doesn't work
"As a math teacher this has horrible workflows. Can't use a Surface Pro mark up homework. Instead can only put corrections in a single textbox at the side. Inconsistent controls. When sorting HW to make marking efficient... The controls don't follow that sort. Teams is great if you want to develop RSI and get a ""free"" vacation off work. Otherwise I would advise educators to steer clear."
bad
Not working
Bad
Very bad disturbing for students
"Don't ask me to rate your app, 1 star every time"

"I frequently can't send messages, but if I click retry it works(can't you do it for me) Bluetooth headset frequently does not work in meetings, but works before and after for my phone calls. Quality seems to be going down"

This app is good but mobile phone is hanging Ã nd storage full.
Lot of hangs
Annoying and messy UI
Good
"Zero advantages for attendee'sðŸ˜ª, Zero video enhancement and quality Why the recordings are now not saving in streamðŸ‘¿"
"It will not allow me to open it. It keeps saying that the browser version isn't compatible, but I have downloaded the app."
"Does not group notifications. If your phone is off for a couple of hours which is often for my work phone, it will buzz for a few minutes catching up. This kills battery and is very annoying."
It's fine but there always network interferances when people are conversing
Worst app i can't even see files option while uploading assignments
This app is good and voice is very clearly and video also
It's okay it sticks sometimes but will still pass as goodðŸ˜®ðŸ’™
So set seamed to be very troubling for me. I was asked a password before I even set one up. Now im locked out because my email and phone number are already in use. Not getting any choices to fix it. Dont like this and Im not even getting paided for this and Im doing this for a job. :( Boo
"Fialed to send your messaje, every Time Is send a msg from my phone."
full of glitches. Two factor authentication requered every time I open the app. I didn't give it one start only because I need it for work.

"Having problem in opening assignments tabs it always shows something went wrong, even my internet is stable ðŸ™ƒ"
there is a problem on uploading files
"Everytime i open the app i have to log in again. Then it takes another minute until it sorted itself out. It chnages from log in screen to my chat a couple of times, before i can finally work normally again. Often times i can have good internet but the app still says, bad internet."
I think this app is stupid i just tried to enter my passaord for 3 times and it keep saying 'help us make sure you are not robot 'stupidðŸ˜¡
Mic and speaker problem is their while online lectures please solve this problem as soon as possible.
Very poor app on the basis of its network connectivity gives lots of trouble..However its meeting platform is ok..
This is app is to slow .
This is use in during this pandamic but if we on camera so the voice is break
Good
It is very nice app for learning or live meeting .i like this app
This is a very
Nice app
So the reason I am rating its app 2 and not 5 it because first you can' start making a video Directly you 1st need to go to your camera app and then make a video then you can upload it which Takes time and the 2nd problems which is I can't upload any video I can a upload picture but not a video and when I go to report I can't report my issue I don't know why when I click the report issue my OneDrive pops up and nothing else to report which teams should fix to improve the user experience
Good
"The app will send you incoming call notifications, even if you block all settings for this app, in you phone's settings. Moreover, messages you send will mostly fail to be sent, even on LTE networks. It also crashes occasionally."
It is very good at connection but the functions are less
"I am using this app dor my online class. It will drag all the network ,if no network it wil end the call ."
tatti
"Post update, Constant issues, freezing, random sign outs on Android. The app on Mac , constantly asking for permissions on every screen share"
Bad
The app have become 10times more laghu after the latest update...it needs tk be fixxed NOW I will change my review once it is fixed
Bad app
Nice
These app is very useful to me
good
Vedio quality is poor
"Each time I try to setup the safe, after I press ""continue"", the app crashes. Everything else is good. 9/29 - App and phone update, but ""safe"" is still now functioning."
"My school district uses Teams. Being on both sides of the screen (staff and students) I am able to help the students and my own children out. A lot of the time the teachers have no clue what the students see. Making it frustrating for all. There are times it glitches out or crashes altogether. Microsoft is not user friendly in the first place, now add children, parents, and non technology people equals disaster!"
"The app has bad cross-platform support. I have to use either the browser version or the mobile version because the linux client is broken afaik. Even if it worked, the file editing on desktop is busted and often fails to load documents. The meeting chat is only shown on desktop and web, and is missing on mobile. I still gave it 2 stars because when it works, it works fine."
Bug fixes needed. The shared screen is slanting. don't know the reason for it.
Not working for my mobile
This app I have downloaded it several times but it is not showing the option of calendar very disappointing Please check it once
It's too difficult to download
But it have very network problem
i dont get what it means when theres a red dot next to assignments and it wont let me take a photo but its good
It is a best app in time of online studies in app many things can be recorded also. Yes it consumes some net and battery but still it is having options to edit profile and view other persons profile . It is a very usefull app and I liked it also. I would suggest this app.
"When I was using Redmi Mobile .. I could not select my assignment file, could not upload some times irritated..... And they more and more bugs ...please fix the issue quickly .... ðŸ™"
Sometimes the mic is not working properly
Opens randomly which is obnoxious. Otherwise workers fine
"This app (and Teams in general) functions as if it's still in beta. The main issue is syncing, most notably in notifications. Point blank, it doesn't work correctly. Also, comments that you've read on the computer will always show as unread on your phone... always, no matter what you do. Either Microsoft isn't putting much effort into Teams or the company just isn't on par with most others. No matter how much you like Microsoft or Teams, you will be frustrated with this app."
not bad
No more full screen incoming call notifications which is very annoying. Also in meetings too many notifications on every participant joining. Not easy to figure out notification are from which caller (chat or miss call notifications showing in numbers).
"Nowadays I cant open my ms teams. Its even making my phone crazy everytime i attempt to open it. Im even forced to download the company profile, like is that even necessary, my friend's didn't have to dl it tho"
The app lags a lot the entire screen gets stuck and during a meeting you cant mute and unmute yourself neither can you use any other options.
"Personally, I think that the part where you can view assignments and access different teams is good. My main complaint about this app is the video calls part. Whenever you turn on your camera, the meeting becomes gains a lot of lag. Another problem is that sharing screens is laggy and you can't see the videos well. If you're getting Microsoft Teams for the calling part, then get Zoom instead."
"Video layout and quality is very poor comped to desktop version, also the voice quality is not realistic. :/"
"There is some bug now , I have a one plus 7 pro. The app doesn't work correctly"
I cannot login my account in mobule. But works on laptop version
Too Slow to load the app and not showing all the chat heads what I have in my desktop. Rest is cool... Like the audio quality and Interface...
"pls fix the +Add Work, it takes so long to upload the picture and file. i keep passing late because of this."
I cannot upload my assignments in the bar. It is always showing some kind of error. Its insanely annoying.
It's is good app one bad news this app use for classes ðŸ˜’
"Features of Microsoft team app is good or say excellent , but the app sometimes not work properly, It also make mobl hang, the features of sharing screen sometime not work well. it is rqst to do something regarding these issue"
"Extremely slow. It's true I don't have a top of the line phone, but that doesn't justify this. The same happens with Outlook. I guess Microsoft's apps either aren't optimised for Android or you need special phones to use them."
Good app
Not at all user friendly... Even if u enter your name correctly... It shows you as an unknown user for no reason... Sometimes it keeps going off
I have suggestion for you have do something like YouTube when we have to saw video we saw it your recording working but when i have to saw video it's not working
I can't use my chat option even with nice internet connections and with a permission from organizers while a meeting. I donno what the hell is happening it shows something went wrong when i reply something from notifications bar please look into the matter ASAP.
Screen sharing is not good
Can't hear properly
It is a good app but I am facing a lot of issues sometimes when I am in call.
"Sometimes I can't see presentation of our mentor,do something about it."
Dislike
Horrible when I was doing a school meeting they kicked me out then I didn't learn anything
Very glitchy app
Not a good app. It doesn't open many a times then again I have to uninstall and again install it. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Where is the location
ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰
It is not a good app l mean that l have installed it because my online classes during the lockdown are attended on this app so l have given 2 stars because it is a priority and l would advise to NOT TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF IT IS NOT A PRIORITY because when I checked in my settings teams app permissions it showed TEAMS HAS PERMISSIONS TO DRAW OVER OTHER APPs it means that THEY HAVE THE PERMISSIONS TO DELETE THE FILE'S FROM OTHER APPS l think that this is a HACKER APP but l can't even uninstall
"While attending meetings, video become blank"
Nice but..........
Someone people can't find my contract
"This app is very good but now it doesn't work.Why?Please answer my questions.First it really works but now it tells,""this meeting doesn't have an option to join via mobile.Contact your admin to enable joining via the internet.""I want the developers to answer my questions and solve my problems.Thank youðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™"
It hang in between online classes
Hey how to access the meeting recordings while using mobile please reply and plz let attendee to record the meeting also and let recording be available on mobile also plz
This app is hangging a lot
Good
Problem in Removing and Viewing Profile Image . Not able to remove it .
Very worst app
There are so many bugs.it loads for 30 mins and I couldn't attend my online classes
Voice quality can be improved
Large amount of Power and internet use
The chat box is not oppening and if it is oppening it shows U are no longer a participant and in the meeting my voice is not audible please fix it.
Frt
Good
ðŸ˜”
the team not responding
Very bad there no option to update app in the app setting and there should option to delete message what we have posted In the mobile version
Nice app
The update makes the app work slower
It works
"Crashes my computer, chat laggs or does not update in current time"
please add an option of deleting whole chats instead of hiding. please add a feature...during meeting a feature so that we can swipe and see all the members on our phone
not able to download for laptop
It is very useful for my classes . But I have 2 problems . 1 . Uses too much data and yet sometimes it ends calls for unknown reasons at times . 2 . Uses too much battery so difficult to attend classes in one go .
Noob
Volume control on blue tooth headphone not working please do the needful and screen sharing does not work sometimes
Graphics are good but the call always hang and voice does not come clearly.
I like this allðŸ™‚
"Since we added voice, the 3-slide infomercial is KILLING us. EACH and EVERY time we open the app, we have to go through the same 3 slides about using the app to make calls; worse, 3rd slide (Got it) requires multiple taps to dismiss. We can't even answer calls until we pile past the slides, and the calls usually go to voicemail before we can get past them. The app has been updated several times, but no fix. Maybe if someone is killed trying to answer a call while driving they'll fix it??"
Good app but takes lot of space
"No proper management of any feature, Many time app crashes, Message sending fails many time, Uncomfortable to use the app"
"It doesn't have an easy interface, hard to find basic options and difficult to use...."
"Exactly, i was one of who suggested this app to my college(though they were planned about it already)...when our general meeting started we faced a lots gof problems mainly the blur video quality and cracked audio...even there was problems with the screen sharing as well...."
"If it is possible please enable messaging service some features through this app, I can type but send button not pop-up(disable), also some time messaging button disappeared."
Terrible! The assignment section sucks everytime I upload a file it does not upload it just resets and do nothing please fix this! I can't pass my assignments because of this bugs or what ðŸ˜¡
"Everything is fine but, when someone share their screen it appears to me after 5-10seconds of time period. I mean their is lag in video even my network is fast."
"The new update has changed the chat options to call, the chat is more useful so i wish you reactivate the chat option"
"Works great on pc but the mobile version is very glitchy, please fix it as soon as possible."
"Inspite of having net connection it shows no internet, restated my phone and app but the problem remains same"
Hard to register... not user friendly registration... after long registration.. at end.. failed... even i have strong signal
The Android client seems to have some hardcoded limitation that it does not allow high-resolution while sharing content (from a tablet or while in desktop mode (Samsung DeX)). The other participants get really blurry and low-quality image. Please fix this ASAP and allow high resolution screen content sharing in Android based on the current display resolution.
Just good
After latest update shared screen not able to view properly in android mobile could you please provide any update for this issue
"I gave only 2 stars because The live captions aren't useful for any other languages, it only refers To US English so please give options for multiple languages in live captions...!"
Very bad app. It keeps on lagging and the live preview are the worst. Please fix this problem
"This cant get anything right rn, i passed some works in class notebook and it didn't send. In mobile when you open class notebook you dont open the notebook of the subject, intsead jt opens the other notebook that you opened previously. FIX IT"
It is take too much time to join the meeting and in weak network take loot of time also
Too clunky interface! Please make the mobile version better.
"I'm using this application for collage studies, THERE'S NO OPTION FOR RAISING HAND WHILE WATCHING LECTURES... APP KEEPS CRASHING..."
Its actually helpful for me and helped me in the pandemic with my studies. But it creates a problem when someone opens the camera. So the app is not bad but not that much good even.
Nice

"You need to put an option of auto connecting the speaker for audio. I have seen you guys don't work for anyones service unless money is given to you all. I despise such culture of your work. You guys don't put obvious settings for audio in this app and everytime it becomes necessary for me to change the audio settings manually.ðŸ˜  But instead of following my advice you people will just squabble and whine about situations, i am just fed up. Please make your next update have such automated options."
Very bad app
âœŒâœŒ
We don't know who muted and removed us...you must make it appear as to who didi it...one less star for this major fault in this app.ðŸ‘Ž.... I think googleis meet better.. let's see..

Meetings in this app gives very low audio output .
Very Low quality video
It is miss behaveing I am sharing the screen but the screen removed again and again what I do
Very usefull app
"There is a very huge issue when someone removes or mute us, we aren't able to get to know that person. It just shows "" someone removed you from the meeting"". It should also show the name."

"Now I can't send message to group , what's the reason"
Not bad not good
Nice
Very clunky software still
"Best teaching app? Heck no. It's glitchy, full of bugs, and broken! It's servisable at best and a heaping pile of garbage at worst. It's really a hastle to use and most of the time it doesn't even work properly. This is far from the best people."
Lost connectivity now can't log in
"Change 5 star to 2 stars, it always load a blank page. Please fix"
There was a problem in your app please it's humble request do something I cannot send my assignment please do fast

Can't download recored lectures to my tab. Why? Whyyyyy? I can't rewatch my lectureees. Or watch them even once if i missed the live. Uni is hard on it's own. Come on.
"Teams Apps logsoff automatically. How do you guys in Microsoft collaborate using this platform, chat and exchange messages in 2020 where the first thing you meed to do everytime you ever touch the teams icon is that it prompts you to login. Why?"
Poor audio
"Since the last update, everything just..."
Highly unstable. Keeps showing no internet even when internet is working fine. Clicking on notifications doesn't open the app.
Its kinda alright at least I can do ma online homework
Not currently working on Android 11.O
"i have to use the app for work and the ux/ui of it needs a lot of work, learn from slack"
Great app! But consumes lot of internet.
When I chatting in the chat board that very slow to send messages and images.
Rolling sky
Microsoft Teams is a very good app for video conferencing. But in smartphone the recording of the videos are not available in the chat box. Please look up on this matter.
It is a nice app
It requires most of data.
This get so much time to install...
Not so good ad it hang many times and asks to sign in again and again ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜”
DopeðŸ˜
slow to react so many bugs and now again with latest update some functions are no longer working. looks more like obsolete apps than new modern tool.
I have to delete each time I have to attend a class
Nn
Mic and vid problems very often Even it is not because of my device .
This app isn't working properly. When I entered my password it shows it is incorrect. Please clear these issues
Nice
"At least it has a whiteboard and all that stuff but why does it make other attendees the presenter or organizer. And when leaving a group it says group should have at least two members blah blah, it's my choice that I wanna leave or not and when your are on the page where the classes are, you won't see any meeting which is going on until and unless we check it out selves. You turned an automatic app into a manual app. And these aren't just my problems but everyone's. So please fix my problem ."
Not good at all. When I want to check previous post I hover up it automatically hover me down. I did not expect this from Microsoft. Microsoft you should improve this problem.
"Mobile version has lot of bugs, uploaded files gets duplicated and takes lot of time to load"
Its lol
Worst app ever!! HORRIBLE!!!
Study helperðŸ“’ðŸ“’ðŸ“’ðŸ“’
"I am facing the issue when logging into the app, it takes much time to actually show the screen of teams. It keeps loading, no error or something shows"
App is very good for meeting or online classes but during online classes some one regularly removes me from class. There should be some function to either stop this thing or alteast we should know who is doing this
This is my appðŸ‘‰ðŸ“±
It does not show recording in thi chat history And audio is also not clear some time
We don't have chat box only n how we can chat

"Bug in video orientation , When you join meetings through Phone . The person in meeting who has joined through PC/LAPTOP only see the nose and mouth of the person who joined from phone. The solution is the default view of camera should be fit to frame only so see full view of the member."
I am just not able to open it from some days!! i have send reports 10-15 times but no action takenðŸ˜¦ I request the developer to please please see to it i will give you 5 star surely but please first see my problem
"Quite a buggy app overall, quite poor from Microsoft. Half of the time, doesn't even connect to Teams, so everyone appears offline and no messages are received."
Poor experience. Everytime I get some all in between so it just vanishes off. And do not resume. I have to uninstall and install to fix this problem
all chats cant be deleted at once please improve this feature after adding this feature the app will be the best app for meeting..
Notifications don't open in app!
Everything is excellent but one request is when we share the screen and play the video audio doesn't work using mobile or tab...plz enable that option...it will be very great for ppl using mobile or tab
My chat option has been restricted in one of meetings for no just cause
It's nice app but i am facing a isuue related to posted videos.The videos which saved and posted are not available in the app.Just for that reason rating 4 otherwise it would definitely can have 5. Plz check and help me out!
"I can, t take my classes regularly. Every one week later the app was not running. It take too much time"
"Latest update has left the shifts function in disarray. Patchy visibility, poor layout, things have moved with no real improvement in use, very strange update. Please undo"
Not sure
Good

Camera is not working properly
My team option is not showing
Good app for studies
I am rating this 2 stars because the delete option is missing if you wanted to delete the message . Please update and fix this problem
My oar is most of the time block
"This app works pretty nicely on my laptop but when I signed in by my phone,the activity and all is just empty. When I deleted & reinstalled the app and tried signing in again,it says that THE USERNAME IS INCORRECT. Since I am not into my class group on my phone,I am not able to send the pictures of my assignments. Please solve this problem ASAP."
Unfortunately teams is stopping while class is going on.
Works very slow.
It is overall good but it takes a lot of internet and the calender sometimes creates problem and also it requires a lot of updates and sometimes the calls freeze...^_^
Satisfied
"The performance of this app is not up to the limit.... Always opens again and again after the meeting is ended, also poor screen sharing... Not up to my expectations"
Oflate this app is not working properly. During meetings when i minimize the screen then the mobile is restarting on its own.
High consumption of battery
Keeps logging me off frequently and I miss out on messages/calls from my team.
Not good
Not good for meetings
Bluetooth microphone does not connect with teams in mobile. It does not show how many student attended the past classes. It does not show correct number of students .
ÙŠØ¹Ù„Ù‚
Not so fond of this appðŸ˜’ðŸ˜• they really need to work more on it l!! even the screen shared by the other person is also not clear it's blurry all the time
it does't conncet to net even my networking properly.
Not work in android system...plz resolve this issue....
It hangs a lot and sometimes it shows Microsoft teams isn't responding
Consume lots of date..plz fix this
Always have difficulty with Teams and lose meetings
After the update I am finding that whenever I am joining my classes it is not joining
The app gets hanged. If we enter into teams while the call is in minimized mode.
"Although it is very helpful, it crashes a lot it makes the system very slow if Ms team is running then a simple browser will take so much time to open, switching tabs will not work. Although having a good configuration system it still can't handle Ms team. This software really needs an update. Even big games run better then it on my system."
Very bad experience .....in order to see the class slot i have to sign out and sign in every time new classes start.....even my frnds have same problem....
It suddenly sign out meðŸ˜ 
Acha nahi
Thik thak app hai
Good
Nice app
NeelTandel
Its lacking
Ugh. Microsoft just cannot make a UI that doesn't suck.
It needs a call in number for meetings computer only is unacceptable we have folks on the road and suppliers that only need conversation
I tried to add the same event 3 days a week for weeks to come and it kept erasing the events on the calendar. Secondly it's hard to log in and add folks have to research and all these steps for simple steps. There is another app that is user friendly called Band. Poor network connection also.
It is very hard to access you account and it is very hard to control also it has very bad quality
This app is really annoying. I didnt use it for a few weeks and everything I had was gone and the app didnt recognize my account. I had to reset my password and everything and its still didn't work.
"It was working really well. I was using it on my laptop and was quiet satisfied! And then suddenly the other day... when I joined one of my meetings, there was no audio... ""the speaker and microphone are muted; phone audio not available"".. it said. Then I confirmed all the things... checked the permissions, whether they were muted or not [and they were NOT], troubleshooted the program and what not else! Everything else was working well but just Teams got Disbanded. And bingo! It was not just me but all of my friends [approx. 50-60 of us] who were using teams on their laptops and pc's got the same problem. Moreover, there is no way I can complain because these guys are always ""switched off"" from their customer services. And well, I guess it's not just me who is facing this problem. I would really have given a good review..... but this has turned me down!! I would sincerely request Teams' designated authorities to look into the matter and solve it ASAP!"
"New to this at the moment & experienced some minor issues first time using it, once I've got to grips with it I'll adjust my rating"
Overall Good Experience but where's the list of attendees from the participants.
Sometimes it was not working
The app hangs a lot on Android. And the Chat option should have been available in the meeting window. We have to come out of the meeting window and then have our chats sent.
Links not create what's problem
Dont like it
Worst app unable to upload on time
"It's a good app but there's is a problem too , I was earlier using it on my laptop but due to some problem I had to switch it to my phone but I am trying to sign in with my phone but I am unable to ."
"While it works well on my laptop, I attended a training on my cell phone and got dropped at least 10 times. As a result, I was not able to participate in the group exercises and did not get the full benefit of the training."
"Infact data consuming app, space consuming"
"Recent update broke notifications? I no longer get notification popups while the app is in the background, nor do they show on the lock screen."
ÙˆØ§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙŠØ¹Ù„Ù‚ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙŠØ§Ø®Ø°Ù‡
This app is nice but when it comes to scrolling and touching the icons it gets hanged easily
Nice application
I recorded a video in my meeting but I was never able to see that recording again I don't know where it went and I am not able to see it I searched it everywhere it should be like that I recorded the video and it should come in my device or in my photo gallery but it didn't came you should make like that the recording should come in my gallery this is not good have is good but this facility is very bad I don't like
It consume more data and its is very slow rather it didn't work properly
Camera Rotation on surface duo ist Not Gold implementef
I give two stars because it is not showing the screen in my online class and in my mobile it is showing please fix it then i will rate five stars
It's a very useful app and i suggest that all virtual classes should
"yeah it is not a very good app for students who are abesent in class lecture .The problem is the video which you or your friends have recorded while the lecture is going on, you are no way to watch that video and also you can't watch it even after storing it in your local drive ,it will not support by any windows app,which disappointed me ðŸ˜ž a more. Also it has some lagging in video and audio after 1hr of usage. Also recording stopped automatically."
UI is not user friendly. Full of bugs. Need optimisation.. Hangs often.
I use this for school and it's well..not so great.It's laggy and the teachers have trouble with it.The other students in my class have the ability to remove other students and it's very annoying when they do it.They can also mute the teacher and it's ruining class when we are being taught.Zoom is even better than this.My school only got this app cause this was the cheaper choice.Dissapointed in my shcool and Microsoft.I'm a kid and I'm writing a whole professional reveiw on this.Thanks.
"Lovely app, but the android version doesnt appear to allow you to setup recording, IOS yes, win desktop yes, android no ."

"It's very good app but after updated my mobile app it's shutdowns automatically, left from meeting, Shared screen is not visible, showing network issue however I have good wifi connection. Please fix the issues..."
This app takes large amounts of data while using. I just finished 2gb data in 2 hours.
"After the latest update app is not working properly , every time when you send something in the chat box you've to Load the chat box again"
Can not see everyone chat box in team meeting
"After the new update it keeps on crashing, and now i can't even open it"
The app is not smoothly working it is again and again hanging and I can't do anything on my device
I am a student and it's a nice app for online classes.But it hangs a lot when I have to switch between 2 accounts. Sometimes the matter of 1st account comes in 2nd!! Do something with this.
Students are remove in team meeting and we are so sad
I don't like the app
"Crashes a lot. Also, now I'm unable to join my organisation's group through the link provided. The error pops up that - 'It looks like you clicked a link from an organisation that you're not part of.' Tries every way of joining the group but no success. I would better recommend using Zoom than MS Teams."
Not a good app would not recommend
Very bad
"Teams works well but Android version is not that good as laptop version as many feature are missing like Vertual background , New Meeting experience , Request Control , White board ,etc ."
I would give 5 star but there is a bug. Someone team echo come in my online class. It's Disturb was very much. It come again and again. My exams are coming please fix
It is very good app
Better
"It's very irritating app. It's just get disconnected while speaking. Sometimes, we can't hear the other person. We can't see him too."
I am unable to create a meeting..i can't find add people in calendar meeting..Help me with this..
Whenever I call someone my call never goes it just show that send a voice mail even if the person is online
Why this app take long time to install
It take to much net in half an hour it take almost 300 mb
doupj
Using the app was good but I can't see the recorded videos which is important for college. I wish this could change
let it go so smooth
Very poor app. My son used it for online class but it takes too much data and of coarse my 1GB data almost over in half a day. It must needed to improve.
"Work app, better than skype"
The app doesn't work properly all the time
It randomly exits when I'm in class. Can't upload a file despite of having a good internet connection. Please fix these problems as soon as possible. Thank you.
Good
It's nice
Because you are not giving me trouble
While attending my online class I just see 8 students including me And even I m not able to see my teacher It was not that good experience
He is wife his mother who is
Long process to start
"Please fix this incredibly buggy app!!! When it was working fine it was perfect for school, but now it's basically a group of bugs and glitches trying to be an app. Idk why this specific microsoft app is so buggy but do something about it. It seems to work fine on laptops and PCs, but I currently don't have access to one. You need to fix the mobile app anyway...."
We can't ask questions in chat box personnel
This app is great but the problem is that it stucks a lot . The calls disconnect in between though the speed of my internet connectin is 40 mbps
"Its an app to say the least. Video call issues are very frequently and audio is just meh. Its okay as a student,but it could be better"
This app I am using for my online classes actually it is nice but so much problems I am facing
Teams app is good for my online classes but the only problem is there is option to delete the whole chat history.
It was very bad app
The team's app does't get updated
It was a nice app
super app
"I dont know why wont it let me sign in through my tablet. I even logged out my id from other devices still it says we cant sign u in? Why is this happening, pls resolve this asap."
I want only one update in teams =block the personal chat anyone and block user
I give 2 stars because its beta program is full and background effects not visible in mobile do something please teams app boss
Please add an option to hide the name bar on mobile app! It disturbs with the content shared?
Lots of voice issues
Ppt. Gone in the Middle of the meeting
Quite slow usually.
Worste app i never seen it very very worste app dont download it
It's not a good app but okayðŸ˜Œ
Horrible had to get rid of 209 mb for a 45mb app waste of time and space
"This is not fair, that you are not answering any review of anybody . How they could know that you are working according review or not .But in my opinion this is nice app .Only one problem is that when I search any thing related to meeting then it show no result are found . How could it be when that particular thing is related to class meeting.Just an example - In assignment is written channel name that is (VIII A CLASS )but when I am sending my assignment then in team app channel are asking ."
This app is good but it's saying I can't chat with my friends why
"Not optimised for mobile. Has problems, viewing shared screen during a call. Sometimes when both my desktop and phone is connected to the internet, if a call comes, even if you have picked it up on a device the other keeps ringing."
Battery charging very fast down in use of this app
i think its great use for online classes and everything but one thing is that its halway or the powerpoint presention freezes overall its fine.
Nice game
my account coudn't log in. It says wrong password even if i put my correct password.
I had bad experience because chats are not refreshed and also there is no option to refresh. I had to go back every now and then to refresh it so that I can get new chats. â˜¹ï¸ðŸ˜¡
It lags alot
its better than zoom but lately we cant download recorded lectures and ms teams just makes the recordings unplayable
It is not responding many times
I can't login into a Microsoft account
The audio quality is not good and the software freezes occasionally.
The assignments are not being uploaded...
"The app just doesn't show my name when I enter a meeting. What's seen is either my email or my phone number through which I have signed in. Plus, I can't even use MS Teams as a Guest! I'm compelled to sign in first. I could've missed my exam in this rutt. The laptop version works well though. If the app is updated and allows the use of MS Teams without the need to sign in, I'll change my review. But for now, a definite no for the app, the laptop version is good."
"Soo many issues no matter how many updates, very irritating, uses data like water, a lot of glitches."
Good but not so much
This is very bad app our school upgraded to it from zoom since on month I cant even use many features like zoom I like zoom and hate it....
No comment
Since the new update of teams there is a new glitch that we have to continuosly go to chat and refresh the screen too see what the people have written . And there are a bunch of more glitches ..
Bad
It is good homework and. Class work app
Its not secure fully There is no privacy of your phone number and few other details
Not good app as expected. Lot of improvements needed to this app in all conditions.
Not seeing recording video
It hangs too much..... Yet voice call is clear but not video.....
"My friend is getting picture in picture mode but iam not , ye kaha ka insaaf hai ?"
"It's So Bad ... The Owner Of The App Should Fix This Sometimes Suddenly I Get Kicked Out Of Teams for 1 hour , And Then I Can't Do My Online Classes..."
Not so much best Bro
"It is indeed a good app for online classes but recently I had been facing many problems like updates, automatically shutting down, not performing well, and most importantly there is continuously glitch in this app and like because of this reason I am always late for the classes!!!!! It almost take 10 mins to open!! and then 2-3 mins to join the class!! and then if you have more than 2 I'd in this then you are absolutely gonna face problems!!I suggest you to work over it!!! ........"
Nice app
cannot switch to bluetooth earbuds in the middle of a call like the ios one
Generally inferior to zoom at this time. Android implementation is lacking many usability elements and features. Woks pretty well on Windows x86 platforms
Very good
kKl
screen recording facility should be available for attendees which would help the students doing classes on this app
Can't use from my Android
I hate this there is no option to delete the uplaoded file ðŸ˜­ by mistake I've uploaded my resume rather than I have to submit a research paper omg ðŸ˜­ please give options to students na a delete button only we are only lil kids na we made mistake everyday omg tomorrow my HOD will gonna scold meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
so so app.
"Frequently ask for credentials, once I move away from network, the app doesn't work at all.. I am totally disconnected until I delete this app and reinstall again"
It's a nice app and it's so useful
Not good at video presenting.....also it had a very bad sound quality
Not properly respond
Falla mucho
This is very harmful app
I can give only 2 stars for this app.this is very confusing app.but our online classes are held through this app
I am using Ms teams for about 5 months It's working was quite GOOD but know i am facing problems ro use teams. The App doesn't respond accordingly
dudee i hate that because we r studiying on it
It's good .sometimes echo occur
This app on mobile is useless
"This app is great for people who use pc but people who use mobile or tablet, there are endless glitches. Everytime i want to join my class it glitches and never let me follow my class. And worst of all the chats are disabled. Please fix this app."
Disappointed.(1)App requires a very high network connectivity and also concistancy in network which is only possible when we use WIFI *(2)Doesn't work with a 4G connection absolutely not i experienced app suddenly stops and also on 4G network there is always a caption that displays 'WE DETECTED A SLOW CONNECTION' (3)Web version or windows version does not have such problems.*(4)In Android teams app files shared in a channel SOMETIMES DISAPPEARS after a Refreshing the page which is very annoying.
It just stopped working out of nowhere
Because online classes are conducted
Really good at first but previously MS Team just keeps on crushing even though network is stable and device memory & storage perfectly have adequate available space. And I now consider Zoom as a replacement for this app ðŸ˜©. Please fix this and I will change this review
When I am in a meeting my ipad glitches and I get Kicked out of the meeting also when my mic is opened no one can hear me
No calls option after several updates also
Please add block option in teams chat To block others chat
"It's good for studies but whenever I open, it always asks for my password nd when I enter the password, it is like ""your password is incorrect reset it"". What is it?? I don't know, but due to this issue, I can't attend my classes."
This app can be updated nicely and fill more features in it. I am facing problem because of the assignment section please improve
Need a chat delete improvement
1% progress has been done
WANT BACKGROUND OPTION IN ANDROID
"It was working better. But recently, facing very stuck & slow, may be after updation. Pls fix it."

"Nice for do meetings and all but If we send any image to any one then the app gets closed and the image does not goes to the another person, I don't know why?"
I need a simple app to continoue my online classes but this app is too much conjusted and it also have a lots of voice problem. I would request microsoft to look into it. Please.

I like this app
Leee mari
Nice ap
"This application is annoying, a lot of bugs. I read messages on pc, but on the phone the messages are marked as unread for other couple of hours in some cases. I received messages in some cases with a big delay, big can be hours versus desktop application. Bugs bugs...."
Like this app..it asks for a pin so I cant log in...what does it mean-
Useful but confusing to navigate
Not the best because I have to have mamas help
"Generally good, but obviously still evolving ... each additional rating star shall probably be warranted with a few additional (not simple incremental) improvement app releases"
So I was going to text my friend. Then it said Administrator has disabled chat for this user. There was nothing bad on it. Can you fix it where it doesnt do that.
After lateat update I feel that it's drops call so many times. It becomes black screen and call dropped. Kindly fix this issue.
Wireless headset mic will disconnected after 10 minutes... both mobile app also desktop...
Please add the feature as to know who is the one removing from the meeting.
Battery drain
"It is good but not not very good i.e when I am open it , it does not work properly and it is not a good app"
"After updating, have not been able to log in to my organization anymore."
In my android phone raise hand option os not there and some time i cannot see chat option also while attending the meeting.
"I can't view all participants while using it in mobile devices. Unlike zoom, you can swipe to view more participants. Please fix din the maximum participants i can view was only 8, no swipe gesture or other options to view the others. I'm using it for my online class please fix as much as possible."
Very nice app for students and youtubers
"It's nice but sometimes in the meeting I get out by no one even presenter or organiser also don't remove me.please fix this bug app creators,And when I update it sometimes it says can't able to update if again it doesn't work check common problems solver or anything else"
It's good but I can't chating in the team chat and can't be in video calling
Some controls and features is missing. It's not great for online class.
Avrage
"Pls improve the presentation experience I have a lot problem in that u should improve it ,,ðŸ˜¶ I also have a problem in assignment that only jpeg opens none of the pdf open in my laptop pls fix it"
"This app is some what good,but I find many problems in it."
It is good app to chat and call together. I got a very good experience will surfing through the app. I will suggest ever one to use it.
"This is a good app. But, when I forget my password I am not able to submit my assignment works.."
How to find out the class recordings? It's not clear.
It is a good app but very iratating app.it also changed my gmail password without telling me
While connected via bluetooth sometimes it connects bluetooth audio and most of time not able to connect bluetooth audio. Please fix this issue.
This app consumes a lot of net and any one can mute to anyone and any one can stop the recording which we are started
Do you guys even test your products?
Got some bad features
It is a nice app but it still doesn't work properly and I am removed from the meeting 11 times. Please work properly. And sometimes it shows teams is not working and every 2 days it shows teams isn't responding. It is not user friendly.
Nice
Please enable background options on phone . please enable background options on phone Their is a bug it tells to sign in again and again please fix it .
I don't understand why have they removed chat. And know updated and is not going good
"It's a really useful app, especially during the lockdown time. Provides a good learning experience. Really good app... But the problem is now I am not being able to view the meeting recordings..Please ment it soon.."
Voice and network problem
Good
Very bad
We can't chat privately without signing
Plz maintain your technical problem ..we are not getting records of our meeting
Not to good
Please add public chat option
"It's been offered as a free app / tool but when I try to get it, it sent me use to Skype instead. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ I am confused."
Great app but doesn't connect to Bluetooth mics / speakers properly or consistently. A BIG mark down for that.
"Inconstant UI, right out of the Windows world. Unreliable notifications. Multiple reminders. At least it is better than the Mac desktop. No one would use this over slack unless they were forced to by their company."
The app is good but sometimes it is very slow and it starts glitching pls update and make it better
Not clear voice and screen
"Works for the most part except that meeting invites, and the link provided for them, isn't recognized by the app (or even hyperlinked), so you have to manually copy and paste the entire message into a web browser, trim the ""you've been invited to..."" part off, and THEN you can join the meeting. Pretty inconvenient to say the least"
Lags so much on my pc
"buat upload tugas lama, entah kenapa guruku pake ini, mending gâˆžgl3 cl455râˆžm"
Its not opening in vivo mobile
"This app is terrible. When you join a call you cant use the chat box! I mean, Its a great app for communication but not calls."
Very slow app .. makes phone too slow and very slow app very much.. not at all recommended. wasting time always
This app is not providing all features which are shown I am not able to open chat option during the meeting and personal chat is also not available in it. Please help me Microsoft Teams developers
A waste app it's always hanging superb waste appðŸ‘¹ðŸ‘¿
Great in terms of having access to your teams account but the app often starts opening and closing itself and switching from the current app then back to my home screen. I think it is trying to log me out or in again but closes itself before I can see. The only way I can stop this is by forcing the app to stop which takes a while because it keeps opening itself and taking me out of settings and then back to the home screen again.
"IT CRASHES EVERYTIME , WHEN EVER I LEFT A MEETING WHILE USING OFFICE MAIL ID AND IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS WITH MY PERSONAL MAIL ID AND FINALLY IT CONTINUES TO DO THAT AND APP NOT STARTED .... PLS. SOLVE THIS PROBLEM..."
Sometimes I can't open the app; when I click on the meeting link only black screen appears. Even if I entered the meeting app getting crash.
Nice
"It was not excepted from Microsoft. The chat box is not there, and also I am unable to raise my hand"
It's lagging so Much
It's EXTREMELY slow. Bad quality
Nyc app for meeting....But many times my name is not visible to organizer and attendees....
Lots of bugs and unstable app
Please include attendance download feature in this. And including audio in screen sharing
"I have lots of download issues from its new update. Whenever I download a file,audio or anything even of small size it takes lots of time . Further, on downloading it notified that the file has downloaded but it doesn't store in my device ðŸ˜ž I don't understand where it goes. Even in my Android device the recorded meetings is also can not be played actually it doesn't show itself the recorded meet my Android 10version"
Ok
I can't see who is removing me from the meetings..ðŸ˜‘
This is an extraordinary app for meetings and online classes
Good app
I give 2star because if we pin a person two icon come on full screen
There are so many flaws in this like it getting disconnected though network in high.
Good
Not bad
I have an issue on rotate When i use this application my screen does not rotate even if auto rotate is on It rotaes when i go to particupants and came back to meeting And whenever any notification popup the screen once again doesnt suppprt auto rotate so fix that glitch as soon as possible
Good
Hi i I'M RAGHAV SO THIS APP GOODðŸ˜·ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜Š
I m unable to find my downloaded files and videos anywhere in my fone or in this app
My background option is not coming Why.........
Bring the old update back i don't want this update i am giving it only 2 stars
My screen always blink
Its doesn't always show new notifications for me ive missed updates from lecturers and I've had no idea until I've physically went and checked the chats ( upto date phone note20 ultra)
While typing msgs the notification shade comes down. Many times the chat window closes and goes to the contact page.
no celular nÃ£o tem como mas ver as aulas gravandas
It's a good app but I can't change my team name i mistakenly write it wrong now I can't fix it can someone help me? it's urgent
It worked at first but suddenly the chat and calling stopped working I tried many times to try to fix it but it won't work
I hope that Microsoft will make it better because our online classes are running on this app
This is not allowing to switch between different accounts and shows - something went wrong error message
"In my desktop app, I'm having network instability issue even though my network was stable and I checked it for one week and one this happens inside teams."
Not so good because we can see only few people in online class.
Microsoft is not good blah blah blah
Nice app
This app is good and fantastic
Use ful app
Nice app for student
"i get a notification at the bottom of the screen ""we have detected slow internet connection"". but the internet speed is intact! The app does not updates itself hereafter. it behaves weird!"
App doesn't work properly. problem occurs in between. While working. Assignment are not be able to send .
bad Video quality
It is ok
"Not so good ,cuz people like students are getting hacked not recommended"

Efficient app.
"The app is really helpful nowadays for Online classes, but i just want like there's an option for the recording of the meeting so it's only available to the organizer so i would suggest that maybe till the next update please make the recording available to the ones who are attendees Or presenters too. And also bring back the possibility to message someone personally, this feature is hidden now. This app doesn't keep the back up of the last meetings, atleast shouldn't delete the earlier recording"
"How to send a meeting link on this, it's very tough."
This app is nice but i can not install
Worst app for students and it consuming too much mobile data ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
Can you plz try to use background options in mobile phone because we also want to see how it look
the tablet experiance is just simply a blown version of the phone experience. Making things into 2 Columns Shouldn't be difficult
Has some problems
Zoommmm
System hangs a lot makes device laggy.
Consumes a lot of data. Not favourable for individuals with less data pack.
Notification nahi a rahi or activity bhi nahi a rahi hai.......
Very worst update it is
Allow to swap and see all participants like zoom app Also can participans also access their attendance data so as to know and maintain required attendance criteria Drains battery very fast even if I keep video and audio off. Mobile Data consumption is also high
Nilam
"it can technically function, but there are way too many bugs it's barely usable. and now we can't even see posts from last month?!? bruh"
Wrostest fake bludy hell ghatyaa beqar app dont work ubable to login
- Can't streem the screen with the device audio. - not easy to know who is talking. Unless they talk for awhile - can't mute the participants. - people with links can enter the room even if you cancel the events. - not so much control like if you have a laptop.
This app always gets hanged. And it requires me to clear the cache and reset database everytime I open it.
Not good
I can't download this in my phone. Please check and do needful
Great app but the reason why I'm giving 2 star because we can't use full screen if we tilt screen the names are shown in the corner please remove that names or hide it as soon as possible so we can write our notes which are in bottom right corner. Change that in new update or you will lost your ratings or stars. *One More Thing* Everyone don't have screen share option please add that option for everyone this change might change your rank 6 to 1 because zoom and meet also have that option. G L
Amazing app for school business anything Awesome ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
I have to stop Screen share option in Microsoft teams in android
Full of headache
Best
Good for classes but what is the reason when you can't print an assignment from laptop directly
Cannot forget password
Video quality is not nice
"Loudspeaker is not loud enough like other 'meeting' apps on android mobile... each time we cant use earphone to hear.. initially i thought it would be a problem with my android phone, but the same accuring with other android phones too... Pls check"
App is getting crashed again and again
I like but it's need more network and issues of network
Too much bugs....ðŸ˜Ÿ While iam in meeting app doesn't support..not for me alone ..its for everyone..please fix it
Can do better
It always take forever to log you in ðŸ™‚
Bluetooth headset connection is not working for this app . Develop it
"Sometimes, It doesn't show option to connect bluetooth."
When scheduling a group in the calendar you could not get the telephone number unless you add some to you group. However using this for group therapy you should not have too add someone to get the telephone number to have participants to call in for the group drawback of app. The telephone number can not be charged to the region where you are so for people using home phones they can not call in unless the have long distance ðŸ˜¸ it is not a toll free number.
Wow
For studies it's damm goodðŸ˜Š bt otherwise I don't like itðŸ˜’
Ok ok
Good
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr444rrrrr4rrr4rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr4rrrrrrrrrrrr4rr for pr
It's too good
I cannot change my profile pic i dont know why always saying failed pls try again ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸
honestly not developed right the mobile app is buggy af and most of the time it takes three times to upload a stupid picture for an assignment cos the app doesn't recognize touch correctly
"Edit: As of 9/18 still a bug. So frustrating. About to uninstall. Another annoying notification bug where it switches constantly from ""Only if inactive on desktop"" to ""Always"" meaning my phone is constantly dinging with notifications even as I'm chatting with my coworkers on the desktop version. Fix this."
No data found when on other section for channels even though there are more. Which is accessible with the desktop site
Eats up bandwidth and RAM. Uploading and downloading files an issue. Search is extremely rudimentary.
In new update we are not able to take calls
Why can't we use screen record feature in this app it really sucks please respond ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­...
Not into. I don't like when in the middle of the meeting it want to restart. Ugh*
"On Android of several flavors I have seen so far ..Goes through startup like it is the first time you have touched it, every time you use it. So you have to work around by leaving open. We live on teams in my org. It would be nice if the app was really solid"
I takes 1.14 GB from 1.50 GB for 1 class of 1 hour there is no option to lower the resolution. Sometimes for 5-7 min all the data it takes I don't have broadband connection so can you please help me and there are many technical glitches in teams . I hope you improve this! Thank you !
tiktok
"Full Microsoft Bloat shoved down to mobile format .... works, but slow"
Rest is best but its not fair that we can see only 8 people at a time
Keeps crashing and blackouts
"Frequentemente a tela do celular escurece. A princÃ­pio acreditei que fosse apenas comigo, mas descobri que com os demais integrantes da reuniÃ£o tambÃ©m ocorreu."
When I click in More option it opens . But in more option when i click files to creat a link for participants to join but it not opens. So check it please.
It is good but it do not have appreciable features. It should be improved.
Good
Not able to see recorded videos without downloading. Very bad
The app does not show Bluetooth in the audio options if it was connected after app was launched. That's pain.
Bad
Unable to get notifications despite allowing access and permissions. No issues previously. Only after update then it's haywire!
Taking more data It cannot be reduced?
"I am unable to share my screen, previously I had that option but now when it is needed it is not there. Please help me with that. Being a student it is important for me to use syare screen option but if it is not available only then how m I suppose to show my assignments?"
Getting automatic pop-up. Even if you are not using app it's showing teams page regularly.
The app causes my Samsung phone to reboot when I try to launch it. I have another colleague complain of same issue
"I love this app but you can only see 8 person in a call conference meeting and sharing screen makes it lag, I can't see my meeting organizers screen sharing. I can't download this app on my iPad mini iOS 9.3.5 â˜¹ðŸ˜« so I gave it two stars.â­â­"
highest data consuming app
the new update is third class . it needs to a new update. again it need a new update.
Anyone removes me and mutes me in the meeting
Connectivity is not that easy
We just play on the mobiles but this app help to study on the mobile
High
Unable to login
Nice
The new update is worst
I'm facing many problems while joiniing class .the password we type shows incorrect even after trying 10 or 20 times Without invitation i can't join the class
"Poor screensharing experience, often lag, blank screen, and delayed from host to other participants, never found these problems in other meeting apps."
This app app is owesome. Because some features of this app is interesting.
Good!
Struggling using this app cannot upload a file in the file tab.
I don't know who keeps on removing me from the meeting. There should be something by which we could know who's removing.
I don't know who keeps on removing me from the meeting. There should be something by which we could know who's removing.
ðŸ¤ðŸ¤
I don't like it because my online classes are conducted here
I like the app but the fact that only 8 people can be seen is dumb and also the bug issue which cuts the class and takes you out sucks.
The quality of video is worst than other apps.
The user interface is too flawed. The meeting layout can be much better.
It is a best app but one thing is there we can't record anything that teachers thought
not user friendly
Nice but I'm a student so I didn't like it
"Missing options, unable to use the raise hand option on the tablet. With a large classroom this is really inconvenient"
This is a good app . But a problem is that when we attend our assignments the camera automatically closes
Its better but i have to downoad white. Hat jr on this but niot doeewnoading
so bad
The app is a great app it's just the you can only see 8 people
When it works it's alright. GIFs are by far the best feature. Nice job PR department. But constant getting logged out makes this app extremely unreliable.
Reason as n when chat history increases app starts lagging not only on Android but also on windows..so make it lite n give minimum options ðŸ˜Œ
Why is it not possible to watch the recorded sessions from my faculties earlier it was available but after the update it's not there. What's wrong with u people update means improving and adding new features not removingðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜’
I loved the old version but as someone who uses this app only for online school now that this newer version doesn't allow messaging i can't message any of my teachers through teams and know that they have seen my message. I hope messaging comes back in the next update.
BadðŸ˜¡ .it always start in my pc and even didnt taken permission from me for this. It resulted lag in my pc
I dont know what happen to this app but this app sucks very much i have sent photos it was fine but as soon as i starts onpening the chat it wont open it bring me back to my home screen and says unfortunately teams has stopped working and i have tried force stop and reinstalling the app it still wont do any thing my class is going on and i cant attend them
It always comes in my screen and irrited me
This app was good until today where the chat dissappear and I can't do any calls.
it sucks
Wahiyaat app no 1
Not bed
"It is a good app and needs less updates. The sound quality is also good but the reason why I gave this app 2 star is that I can't see the full video , their is no option for deleting the conversation . I recommend ms teams to develop an option to delete conversation."
"The app has been displaying that the chats are disabled by the administration and I cant message anyone by the app i would have to email them,now i cant quickly ask my teachers questions that i might have please fix this it would help out everyone who has to work and study hopefully you see this review thank you"
"This application is basically good to use in a mobile streaming and audio is very clear but sometimes the video stops unexpectedly and the participant has to turn off and on the video once again, but when it comes to laptop or pc the quality of streaming is very low .I hope the team to fix is as soon as possible ."
Sometimes hang and slow
every time I log off of teams it uninstalls and I only see 6 people at a time
This is an idotic app and the screen shared is not good it's comes in blur but to say honestly it's ok ok
Thia really good app but it is taking alot of net pack and person can't talk comfortely i not like this app to much
"The app is great, but the only problem for me is I cannot locate the location of the recorded meeting. Unlike on desktop versions, you can easily view the recorded meetings on the chat box right after it was finished or ended. Please fix it, and do a tutorial for us to be aware on how we use this app for further awareness."
At times its performance frustrates especially on android phone.
Hate itðŸ˜¡it has so many glitches
Nice but I think this app have some network issue
"Everything is fine , but the problem is when we have to see new messages it takes to much time to scroll so I think u should improve it rest it is good"
"It's absolutely a good app for online classes but, when we go through the classes on mobile phone it's causing a much problem as the screen is not visible it takes a lot time to show screen It's a good app for computers and laptop I request the app creater to update the way that we don't have problems in mobile phone also ..."
Because I has to option of background in phone and put some new background
High battery usage
"Can't access assignments, just keeps on loading. Sometimes can't send files through chat."
"vive dando erro, tanto no app, quanto no site e aplicativo para desktop. Ã€s vezes, simplesmente nÃ£o dÃ¡ pra usar, o que atrapalha muito a minha presenÃ§a nas aulas da EaD."
Very much issues in this app
Worst app ever seen . There is lot of joining problem...irritated by this... I suggest not to use this app ..
This app creat the voice mail in its own and this app should have a option to delete chat it just come hide chat whenever I will search the name of her or his the chat will come back
Hello there is a proplem in the form it is not allowing us to go into a new line pliz fix it asap
I cant chat
"Lot of bugs, from uploading the files to failing in generating sharing links. Great idea, poorly executed. 2 stars."
Poor
I couldnt login My password ia correct but it is not loginðŸ˜”ðŸ˜¡
Cantankerous. After many tries our IT consultant logged me in on my laptop. But the MS Teams app on my phone opens to a black nothing. Maybe this is a toy. Webex is for real life.
This app takes so much time to take refresh after several times of refreshing it does it work properly.
We can't do class very bad
"Gross if you use it with headset. It is fine but everytime it justs asks to install the app if you don't have it and want to join the meeting through browser. Microsoft just forces you to install the app. It should be available, for people who don't want to install it , by website or link. Now I cannot even see scheduled meetings in the calendar. Updates should make the app better not worse. This app stops working if you don't update it"
"Vaahiyat app glitches se bharpoor,kabhi fast nahi chalti."
Nice
"There is no option to delete the whole chat and also we cannot see everyone in the meeting ,and the app is so confusing ...recording needs to be fixed"
Keeps crashing. Can't attend the meetings on mobile.
Very irritating ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
I can't sign in to this app because it keeps saying my password is wrong. Not the case because I've had the same gmail password for 10 years. I really wish I could use this app as my childs school sent me the link so I could support my child with their school work.
Hard in use
It's nice
The app has been crashing several times since yesterday. Updating it or reinstalling did not help. This is the error java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: setSpan (-1 ... 51) starts before 0 at android.text.SpannableStringBuilder.checkRange(SpannableStringBuilder.java:1314) at android.text.SpannableStringBuilder.setSpan(SpannableStringBuilder.java:680) at android.text.SpannableStringBuilder.setSpan(SpannableStringBuilder.java:672) at com.microsoft.skype.teams.services.presence.St
Please give the option to edit name in the app
Still receive phone calls even though all notifications have been turned off. Assume its nothing to do with Android notifications then.
"I literally cannot sign in. I enter my phone number, it brings me to a confirm phone number screen, I add my country, and the prefix gets appended to the phone number, and the country resets. That's all. I cannot proceed, I cannot go back. I finally managed to sign in with my email."
There is no provision to see full screen or make zoom for shared screen. Its very difficult to see the shared screen.
"Not winning at all, can't find the app"
"good app, but only let me in the for time I logged in. It's always ""You're all done. hang on while we get things ready for you."" and after around 20 minutes it's still loading... so I gotta reinstall every time I need to log in...."
When in a meeting with 5 to 6 people my phone gets extremely hot i mean really hot why?????
Would not let me download
Apps crash frequently due to security and goes off not able to update my profile each time I have uninstall the app and download again then login.. This happens when when is not used for more than 3 to 4 days..
"Device: Oneplus6 Teams app has issue when out on loud speaker. The other side does not hear when spoken, but when put on device speaker it does. I see this bug since long time. Please fix this."
"Unable to see option for background effects , not able to copy paste multiple invitation email id's at one go. Have to type each manually, unable to share video with audio."
I do not love it I hate it

The new update is worst. Recoding save is not properly all recorded video gose infinity many bugs..
"Video calls for meeting on free personal version do not work on phone, I will update my review when this has been taken care of. It creates uncomfortable situations when being interviewed on it."
Meeting setting option no available
recently the app become problematic whenever I joined the meeting my phone used to off and doesn't work properly
Ok better
Screen sharing between mobile and desktop app is not compatible. In mobile the screen looks tilted when somebody shares using desktop app. Please fix this
Too bad.When working it goes hang automatically.
"During calls & screen sharing, it keep disconnects and trying for network. Tried with all networks and looks really weird. Really finding tough time in attending office meetings. This should be little lighter version where we easily connect meetings. My phone hangs frequently post installation."
"If a person arranges a meeting only that person should record the meeting..In schools when teachers arrange meeting ,this creates a problem..there should be some more special features for persons who arranges meetings..participants should not disturb them."
Multiple major bugs
Lots of ðŸžðŸ‘¾
Recorded videos are not working...
The app is so complicated that you will have to do a PhD first... Don't expect normal people to use it.
"Its good but I am giving it 2 stars as, 1) It hangs the phone during classes. 2) sometimes it takes soooo much time for opening app. 3) sometimes waiting in the lobby makes me impatient and than also when teacher is admiting me with good network connection too... I want to only to say that these issues should be correct ."
I don't have chat boxðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜

This app is very bad
"Now a days, teams keeps on hanging very frequently and says we are having trouble connecting. And this happens at once in mobile app, desktop app and web app. Very irritating."
"there some bugs when i switch org, my historical chat not show completely"
I like the teams app and it expreence
Uploading and deleting issue.
Ok
Ok
Not to bad
I am not able to asses files

Removing option is absurd either it should be used by organiser or someone who have been given permission to remove by organiser
This aap is best for reading
Very poor app
It is nice app.
It is better than zoom.. But its previou version was best.. This verson is not that good
Mulai 15 Sept 20 sampai sekarang Teams error melulu.. tolooong...toloong.. ini screen share ga bisa muncul niii...
"still not compatible with samsung dex, full screen button is disable, error in downloading files."
This app is really interesting and has nice features too but the only issue is after we record our meeting we can't find it so plz help
It is good app but network consumption is more so please do these
Not the best dosent really cooperate with me
I use it for school and I don't like school :(
It's need good and stable connection so it would good for every user
"Lately the app keeps requesting to choose a keyboard. I have the app on my Samsung S20 and I can't do anything to get rid of the request to choose a keyboard. There is only one option available but it still won't stop popping up the request window even after chosen. And because you can't pass the window, you can't use the app."
The app is amazing in conducting a meeting but; No sorting facility for members Can not download meeting recordings That is why 2 stars for this app As of this current update..
unable to connect all the time
Because you asked me to review 6 months after I left a 5 star review. Sort it it MS
"The files section is so glitchy, I can't even zoom out of my notes and I struggle with online classes"
Closing again and again Very slow to operate in medium range phones
Stopped working with android 11. I can no longer sign in with my work email.
"It is a good app ....... really useful ......... network issue occur rarely ......... also a multipurpose app ........ we can get assignments, chats, calendar, etc in just one app ........ its great....... plus u can get calling facilities....... but the worst part is that the administrator can manage your account....."
Getting worse with every update.
Can we download 2 teams in one phone only
It takes a long time when I upload my pdf ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•
Only works when the app is reinstalled.
Is Microsoft team is a useful apps for meetings and to schedule a meeting it is useful to work and it's free also but I don't like one thing that only meeting organisers and presentation can share the screen and my teacher don't say to on the camera but sometimes my teacher said to me that if you are telling answer or reading anything so you have to on your camera on my camera my teacher also cannot see my face what is not my connection problem that is your connection problem improve yourself .
Y'all i need free background on phones not just blur thingy
Bad service
Useful but the join option is non-responsive. And the app laga a lot. Plenty of room for improvement
"We're able to have a limit of people on the screen, the problem is, sometimes they do not show up when the teacher asks to show a drawing or something like that, I'd say it'd be better if the app had like, pages, you could pass and see people"
Logs me out every day!!!! So annoying!!!
Massive flickering issues on Pixel 4 XL As soon as the 90hz engage you will see the screen flicker.
doesn't allow me to use the chat which is ridiculous
It is forcing me to download Intune as well... Without that I am not able to use the app
This app is great when it works. But most of the time it does not even load. I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work. That's a serious problem.
It is very tough to open this app I don't like it
Its good app for future education during this pandemic. But i dont like it because it shows only 4 to 9 person at a time and why only presenters can share??? You need to change this........The attendees can't do anything that is why i dont like this appðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£. If you will change this app and make it like zoom app so i will give it 5 stars and if not you deserve this!!!!!! Plz make this app like zoom cloud meetings app Plz. If it will be like zoom app my ratings will be from 2 to 5ðŸ˜‘!
The teams is not working properly now (as of September 2020). I have to attend my online classes on this platform but now it has started creating problems. The app often crashes in the middle of a meeting. The recordings are no more available in chatbox for us to access now. Most of the time we face problems while uploading any material on teams.
Not clear video and sounds
It lags a lot on my computer it's is not worth it for my online classes i even have a very good working wifi and so much space in my computer it's the first application in it Microsoft plz fix it

Doesn't work right since the new update. Not receiving messages on the phone at all and constantly asked to sign in.
Buggy can't access recorded meetings
"Teams is great , the app sucks."
Boo
"I like the interface and features and enjoy using Teams on PC. But this mobile version pretty regularly just refuses to send or receive messages without notice or explanation for a few minutes or a couple hours at a time. This has happened across multiple devices and carriers and it simply makes the app useless. It's really frustrating to press send and just see an empty circle where the ""sent"" checkbox should be."
Very nice
4200 grad pay apo. Old pension apo.
"The previous version is awesome but after update sometimes teams doesn't responding and video quality not that much good as shown In pictures and chat column has been removed, but I like this app..if we edit the profile pic in previous version we can crop where ever we want but after the update the pic is directly set as profile photo plz make change in above mentioned prblm"

I am not able to reset my password from how many days I am trying.
"Sounds quality is good, and video quality is also good. But somes times it cannot connect the call."
We are sitting in the lobby for so long
Nice app ðŸ‘Œ but after the update it's the worst app I hate it the chat box disable the recorded screen expires in 20 days .but I am giving 2 stars for previous version . please make necessary changes.thank you
"Not able to upload the assignments. It just says there was problem, remove the file and try again uploading it.... I tried with all types of file formats available out there... I even tried to upload from various platforms but nothing works. At last I mail my logs to Microsoft teams but there is no reply from them... It's already 2 weeks now. Please do something"
At first it was working fine. But since months I am unable to login . Everytime it says the user id doesn't exist. Getting irritated now.
There is no chat box
"This is so painful, the app crashes everytime whenever I attend my online classes. The call drops immediately when I join the meeting, then I rejoin again and then again call drops. This is affecting me so badly. Please urgently look into this. As a student, these online classes are our one way to study. So please I request you to look into this. And where are the recordings in the mobile app, it's not visible!!! When the classes get recorded,it's not visible on the channel."
It's nice but have some bugs and more internet consummation occurred
"If we join to organizations it gives lot of issues And also asks for password again and again, Even if we enter password right it says incorrect password..."
Continuous error of slow net detected... On whatsoever connection it wud be
It doesn't work properly bad stuff
It's a great application but it hangs a lot likeðŸ˜³ and is not much user friendly . The chat also hangs and if you download it in your pc your system gets hang and catches virus for sure
No proper connection
Not so nice ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
"No me gusto actualizacion, era mejor cuando unx podia ver la clase en la misma aplicacion y ni tenia que descargar porquÃ© muchas veces el archivo no descarga o descarga mal, los odio (gracias)."
This app can be make more better because video conferencing quality is not that much good that it can be.
"This app is good for meetings , online classes, etc. But it has so many problems, sometimes it does not open, sometimes leave meeting suddenly, etc. So I request to update it and make its better."
The app keeps logging me out. I use teams for work and this issue is causing me a lot of problems
"It is terrible. The new calling feature is trash it makes it so that you cant even see the old bar that would pop up in the middle, private viewing has also been removed and recordings expire after 30 days. Please fix this. The only good thing is that this app is somewhat secure."
wrost app i make 2 id but it is always shows incorrect i could not open by using email help me
I got kicked out so many times due to lag and the new update isn't helping out and teacher got mad
"the chat feature is horrible on the mobile app. instead showing the recent messages, it goes back to the top every time you close it/open to read new messages. you have to keep scrolling so much to see new messages during the class."
"The app crashes and close immediately my teacher shares a slide. I'm tired of switching from phone to laptop, please work on it."
Still no experience
Not very bad but please try to improve it...
It let's me do all my assignments with no fuss thank god really good app
I cannot view the whole video as some part of it is occupied by the profile icon which is not mobile!!! I'm getting constantly logged out of my account..
Fantastic
Good application for online modes of education Now it's very poor working please improvement your application otherwise I leave and delete this application It's disappointing in My opinion of online Tuition
Not good 'et conection
"very hard to search in history, keeps asking for credentials after a password change"
The launch of this app not as smooth as Outlook for android. During calls it does not recognise the bluetooth headphones.
Not good enough... But still useful
Bluetooth headset doesn't get connected
This app take lot of data network please solve this issue ðŸ™ðŸ™
Very bad response

Ch Parvathi Ch Parvathi The thing is we can't clear the chat n could not delete the calls but the app is good in education

"It's been going off especially when I need it for a meeting. ""Hang on we are almost done"" is the feedback."
I cant able to update ..
"App drains battery unusually. Plus when i tap the notif, the app doesnt open. Very bad experience with the mobile app. The pc client is extremely good though."
"It's a nice app,,,my problem is,am not able to write my official names, secondly,am not able to locate some files,"
I am not able to raise my hand through Microsoft team and when I click to update button it doesn't update
This app is so cool that I even do online lessons with it
I gave two stars because I can't remove my profile picture
Sooo many glitches
"This app is good but i faced two problems during use it. First one is during meeting in post old chat always come first. When we use the app for long time, it take more time to scroll through the old chat and it is annoying. Second thing is sometimes present screen is not appear in my app but it appears on all others participants. It makes us to think presenter stop sharing the screen. And there is refreshing button also."
Why can't i put virtual backgrounds? My app is updated.please fix
This app is really good

Unusable with a blutooth headset.. Always choosing to play on speakers

Using of Bluetooth earpiece during calls are no longer supported. Please correct that in the next update.
I use this when I have online class and it always lags
A unapiling colore skime and hard to navigate

There's a lot of space for improvement.

Online classes

It's very difficult to log in ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
Worst app
"This is not bad app but I have problem, In my class I open my camera but ma'am could not see me but other one open camera so ma'am is available to see themðŸ™ðŸ™"
With full network video is always hanging
"Good concept , very laggy, Can't open another app if you're using this app, not recommended"
"As an official app for a lot of students it's bad , It should be more abilities less problems but in this app it's the opposite."
ðŸ˜Š
Unfortunately So many glitches...
ðŸ‘

Harish Gupta I faced three issues ...... 1.. There are not chat privately... 2..there was no clear profile photo.. 3..this app take a high amount of data...
Needs work
Yime Potom in my app creating team option is. not there...
"Though the features are good. Rated as 2 star due to the reason, this app is NOT mobile friendly. This application consumes a lot of memory and also lot of time to refresh/load a mail. Can you make this application lighter? By adding an option to load messages from the last 1 week, 2 weeks etc rather than storing the data from last 2 years or infinite time? Want to see Teams to be the Mobile Friendly app."
Few time back i was able to check recording but not able to do so now i don't know why and the hate the chat functions landscape just like the landscape mode it applicable to video call it should also be applied to chat box and allow us to see faces as well as reply
Uploading files in this app becomes a problem
Improvement is needed
"After the new update the recording needs to be downloaded that to only in the laptop or pc , I can't see the recording on the android phone. Please work on that."
Good but some features should be improved ...... Like network issues Today I was replying the answer to my geography ma'am but could not hear me and removed me from the meeting ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘ºðŸ‘ºðŸ‘ºðŸ‘ºâ˜ ï¸â˜ ï¸â˜ ï¸ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ I am not telling other issues with this or I will overcome the limit of words ...............
Fairly good.
It is the worst app
Bad
It is a good app but when we need to download it still we use a link
Please you can update the app and know some one remove in the meetings and mute somebody please when you updated the app and check.
I'm not able to chat in chat box when the meeting is going on.
The ID s are easy to hack. Suddenly wants password . Can't change accounts. Can't attend meetings sometimes and have to reinstall. Can't join . Great idea. Horrible app.
I couldn't joining my meeting at proper time just because join option doesn't come faster
Excellent app .....I'm using team app since april .....bz of lockdown we can't went to school ....but we have our school in our phone in the form of team app....thanks Microsoft team app team...keep doing work add new features in this app...ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ƒðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™
Will
This voice is not good
I don't like this so much
My notifications are not coming
It some times open own it's own.
Nice for meetings I like but not very much
Good
Its good but one priblem is there I cant record meeting in the app
It's ok but teams app is not convenient for mobile users it is suitable for pc bcoz we are attending meetings sometimes they'll record the meeting if we see in our mobile as a attendees the recording has vanished. So it is convenient only for pc users.
"After shechdule the meeting join option is not coming and recording the meeting option is not coming in my mobile. You can give your mobile number. So, more things I can tell you."
It was good app but not very good and this verson is not good
Good app but when I attend meetings first screen starts blinking then it shows teams isn't responding then I am no more in the meeting............ Plz do something for this ............
Volume was low.
This app is very difficult to sign into i spend more than 2 hours trying to figure it out
Fabulous
Office 365 password changed and i cannot use the teams any more as it will not ask for password but simply auto login and goes with a infinite loop. Why dont you give an option of entering new password after password change
"When I used it in computer it always hang. When I open my computer it automatically start. But, in mobile it works almost well. But , if there is no network it do not connect and I missed my first class ."
Exceptional. Expecting password changing policy?
app froze when it signed me out by itself. need to uninstall and reinstall it for me to be able to login
"If I'm available on the app, it should not show me as idle."
"This was an amazing app, but i rate it only 2 stars because of tye intune app. After this app i cnt do anything.ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ‘Ž"
It'll be better if audio is enabled for video files in android phones
"Cant download easily , and it slowly hangs to 90% only, why?"
"For video conferences, have it to where you can designate a speaker/presenter and have it be the main video feed with all the extra participants at the bottom. With this app being the pick of numerous virtual classrooms around the country right during Covid, having teachers and lecturers have the same size video feed as the other 10+ students in the class is not a good idea."
It's an average app some features are not good.
"We use Teams at work, and there's no way to call into Teams using a phone number. We run into a problem frequently because our remote systems do not have a microphone. So the only way for me to connect is to have Teams installed on my personal laptop. In this scenario, I'm unable to share what's in my remote. It's just too cumbersome and not intuitive to use."
This app is very amazing and i have given it a review it before and i have given this app 5 stars but i have given 2 stars in new review beacuse in the new update of teams teams managment has deleted the chat and they have very wrong because if we only want a small thing to our friends so we have to make a call than i have to say everything and also like we want to send a small thing to our physics mam so we have to do a call and then screen share and all that process.Teams management please
"Easy to use and helps me communicate with the office while I'm on the go, or even just outside letting the dog out for her walk! I never miss a thing Werth the teams app! Changing review as I can not get notifications of call on my Samsung. Beyond annoying."
Teams forces you to use the google keyboard. Absolutely no reason for that and changing the keyboard is a phone wide change. I dont like the google keyboard at all. If the app ever changes and lets me choose my own keyboard I may consider reinstalling. But for now it has been removed from my Android phone.
"I like this app but in this pandemic I have to give test's on phone everyone is messageing, unmuting and disturbing I hate online classes"
Good
Insists that i login and keeps popping up. Classic microsoft
Very nice
This app is not bad for studying online but its functions are not very easy to find. Lots of problems arise b/c of unavailability of location of features. Also it takes too much space that u can never think ur phone will be free in matter of space.If these functions are updated then I might give it 5 stars as ranking Plz do the following
"Teams is a great app for online classes, although there is a very persisting issue of audio increasing suddenly to maximum capacity which you can't lower in smartphones and gives me headache if I have to attend lecs for hours together. Also, in meetings in channels we should be able to see the latest texts at the bottom every time a text pops, but the app always takes you towards the very top, which is pretty annoying and you have scroll endlessly to get to new messages. Please fix this issues."
Not appropriate
"Before some days Microsoft team allow phone users also to watch recording. But now,after a new update, recordings is only shown to computer or laptop users. The computer users are also need to download it first and then see it. I suggest that you should enable showing recordings to mobile users. It's a humble request."
"The application would be good for academic purposes if it would be quite forgiving on how it consumes power and if the app is made stable. Getting that ""Microsoft Teams isn't responding' pop up sucks. We need to enjoy the MST services the way ZOOM, Google Meet and WebEX teams renders."
"Very slow, not properly working"
"Firstly It shows online even when you aren't, Secondly, its notification tone is very short unlike Skype. You cant even hear even if in the same room. GUI is less user friendly. When you install it on your phone there's no notification sound at all except for a vibrate."
Frequently disturbing by display over other apps everyday
Need to improve dark mode
The image quality was not as aspected. And i cant present my content
"One of the slowest and clunkiest apps I have used. This is true for the PC version as well, as I am forced to use it for work."
New update is totally worst.
ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
It disconnects ALOT
"The PC app is good but the mobile app lacks many features. This app is not made for heavy use I guess... If you're attending a meeting and also chatting personally with someone side-by-side, this app stops responding and suddenly gets stuck, at the end you'll have to restart it. At times I am even unable to restart it. This app makes my phone get stuck. At the end I have to restart my phone also. It doesn't support landscape orientation other than the meeting screen. It must have this feature ."
It was great before the update. A lot of features that I used to use in the previous months on mobile are now disabled. I always have to use a computer now to see files sent by anyone. I can't view on mobile. This is very inconveniencing. Recorded meetings used to be easy to view once the meeting was over but now this download option is the worst. Most of the time downloaded videos don't work at all. Beats the purpose especially if you are using the Teams platform for education.
It is not able to make me download work
not good
1) No background settings 2) No large gallery option 3) No Chat box option Pl see to this problem other wise it is a good app
"Teams is just so far behind the ball in this arena. The service, the app, the desktop app... Works if you need it, but it's pretty bland."
Not for a good experience
Fix this mic umutes for too much sound and it crashes because of less internet my phone can run vortex and PS4 screen mirroring easily with slow Internet zoom and google meeting is way! better don't waste your time this is the worst Microsoft app others are so good than this
nice but but again and again meating ended can't hear any voice I can't add any people in meating ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
Some times invite links not appear
It os very good for online classes
Yak such a bad app my mam is giving us the test and I have make it the PDF also but what is showing the problem it is not showing the heading I am facing a lot of problems because of your app I have got marks or not even I don't no in my test also I have really I know please update your self and after that if I am posting my work I not able to see only my work I don't know what has gone to my mam now how I will I know what I have send itðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¾
Most of the time it asks to enter the password
"The app is good but why there is no option of backgroung changing in the phone and if we send something in the chat box, we are unable to delete in the phone. And there are so many options in computers but no option in the phone ðŸ“žwhy??????????.............??????????????? Why this issue,?? ??????.........?????????"
The app suddenly stops running and kicks us out of ongoing call. The issue is there for a while now and its really frustrating when this happens while you are handling business calls
The account is not accessing in this app please do something I have to study the user id and password is given by school the id is signing in but the app is not accepting the passwod can you tell how to make a account of user id and password given from school I have seen 3 to 4 videos on youtube but after seeing the videos also the account is not accessing
Not good every day the nettwork hangs my connnection are good but it has weak and poor connection everyday i miss my classs bcz of teams
In the app there is no icon of team so what i do i am not able to connect my group.
"App doesnt notify me when colleagues call. No settings on phone that could have blocked it. Already closed app -not minimised, on desktop."
I just dont like the new update we cant chat plzzz can u add chat icon plzzz
Some mistakes should be corrected
I dont have a very good experiance with this app.
"Even with a good network supply, the pictures and the other files take too long to appear on the screen..Also the 'add work' for the assignment allows only 10 resources which is inconvenient,considering you have to give more than that. I hope you will fix this issue as soon as possible"
Very bad experience
Saya tidak bisa membuka tugas
Good
"The App Constantly requests the password, so frequently; that's unnecessary and impractical,"
Network issues
Its always error in mobile phone. I cannot see a tab which i couldn't join meeting
Not able to log in. Waiting forever to get signed in.
"We are signing you in, please wait... For ever"
"What part of ""do not disturb"" do you not understand?"
Had a Good experience using this app
Its not installed to mobile phone
Frequently crashing
"This really needs option to stop notifications until particular date. I have vacation and keep getting work messages. I don't want to block it completely, because then I surely forget to turn it on again. I just need to be able to say ""don't bother me for hour, day, week"" etc."
Attendance of meeting can't be downloaded from mobile app Ms team.so it should be improved..
"With latest version..When someone is sharing the screen without calling, in that case we cant record the screen."
Having issue with connecting Bluetooth device kindly fix
It sometimes disconnects me from callsðŸ˜¬ But its goodðŸ˜„
I can't able to upload my assignment.
No blur background feature or any camera/voice settings in this app :(
Would love to use this but it keeps draining my battery. My moto droid play z which usually has power for 30 hours keeps dying in about 10 hours.
Nice
I'm using mi not 5 there are no show chat box please reslove this problem
Dimensions of Shared sharing is not visible neatly for one plus 7t models
Good app
Wow
i can't chatting in any class that so annoying
It's best app bt I have many issued for rejoining to meeting
It's nice app for studied online bt sometimes it will be removed from class and created many issues.
"I can't download it from my android, since waiting for the link from Microsoft"
"The meetings are good but the problem is l can't even join 2 meetings in a row, because when l finish the 1 l want to enter the second teams glitches and doesn't want to open l hate this part the most because then l will go install and uninstall all the time, it drives me crazy installing uninstalling and installing and uninstalling l hate it soo much and worst it takes time and when it finishes l enter late and l don't get many informations forget mentioning the audio, plz solve all these bugs"
"Can't pin speaker! No way to can speaker large (looking at 87 small blank squares and teh speaker). No option to pin, right click nothing. Please help"
Ok good
It's really bad. I'm literally disappointed. I was giving the correct password but it was saying incorrect again and again. ðŸ˜•â˜¹ï¸
"Honestly.. This app is much worse than other apps. During my online classes i have faced a lot of issues like.. Poor image quality, Takes time to load the image, some of my friends werent able to join as the option wasnt even available plus the audio quality is very low hardly audible without earphones. Please improve the audio quality and other issues."
Only satisfied.
"Please fix the issue of attaching pdf files in teams, I can't attach files to teams it says that it failed to read the file and then does not attach, everyone in my company has this issue that are using Android only works on iphone."
Very difficult use and its internet heavy app
During Meeting someone removes people it not showing its name...who removing people form meeting it should be notify.
Mm
It consumes very much battery. The screen frese will representing some time. The audio quality is average. I was not able to see video of other people. We can se only 8 people at a time which should not happen And when we open chat box you have to swipe down to the latest chat which waste time
It's excellent app ðŸ‘
"Off late I have noticed MS Teams interrupting my usage of the phone. When I am using another app, it will pop up asking me to sign in. Even while playing a game. It is a good tool to have as it allows me to stay connected with work, but that's all I want it for... Work. (While writing this review, the app interrupted me). Using Samsung S9+ with Android 10. (Still seeing the same issue). Also, can we have the Sign Out option outside settings?"
New updates are worest
"Cannot sign in, my internet connection is good and I know I entered the right log in credentials but it just wouldnt sign in."
Its the worst app
"What is it with the app? The app after using for few days displays that I am no longer a participant, thus unable to send any messages. However through the same I am able to call. When I uninstall and install it, everything works fine. I have been doing this lately for the last 3-4 times. Is it my phone or has anyone else too observed it."
Latest update is having issues
The host cannot hear me clearly. Either my voice echoes or it is not clear. Sometimes the screen is not visible. Why so? Please improve this.
Not responding
Yes the update is not that good it causes 100 errors in one week
Not good
Not good app it's take too many net
Unable to open app after latest update. Tried reinstallation still unable to open.
This app is not at all optimize for Android devices because even in the latest Android phone the app is crashing. Even though the mobile is able to run heavy apps and games then also this app is crashing again and again. Because of this I am unable to attend my teams from last 1 month please take a look into it. This app present itself as meeting but because of this issue it is unusable so please take a look into the matter......
I don't have the chat option Plz do something
This app is just.......I have good internet(543.87kb/ps)but still this app sucks in middle of my meeting...And many a times it don't even opens!!
It dos'nt respond
Awesome
I cannot use my Bluetooth headset to receive calls. It is just annoying that you are wearing your headset connected to your mobile but you cannot use it in teams call. If it is not fixed than this app is useless for Android
Ramroop Arya It is so good aap
Waste application.
It does not work properly it shows again n again teams isn't responding and my online class stops. . So only 2 stars for u
Actually...its a nice app...but when my data finish..i use hotspot..but it loading and it shows that can't loading...im so worried..i cant concetrated in my work
Bad app not good for us
It consumes to much of my data pack it is the most irritating thing in this app other than that not an issue with this app
Everything else is fine video and audio quality but the chat messages are not deleted is a huge problem please check it out.
It hard to login in school id if we forgot password it takes lot space
"U can also add the remove the file because if ever the file is uploaded by mistake, there is no option to delete it."
Ridiculous ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
"The notifications settings are severely lacking for an app that is intended for business use. I'm shocked the ability to mute all notifications when you are listed as out of office is not available or to even turn off notifications entirely (yes, you can handle that at the system level but it should be included in the app settings). IMO, that should be an obvious feature to allow people to enjoy their vacations without getting the normal messages."
I'm fed up with this app. It's called teams but wasn't prepared for actual teams that logged on.
"The application is useful, it fulfills its basic necessary functions, it has tools that allow a wide development of activities in the same place but with each update they deteriorate something that was previously good, a very unintuitive interface for the amount of functions it has, the app and the errors are more and more common, lack of optimization."
"Meetings won't use bluetooth headset. The option to use my bluetooth headset cannot be selected, only device or speakerphone."
"I wish next time, together mode in Android and you can delete a file and folder"
Immersive Reader can't read Kannada and teachers voice echoes or break during class. If you improve I will give 4 starts review.
It's really nice app
Bluetooth doesn't work.
"There is an issue with the login page. I was unable to log-in after changing my email password. I got a notification from Teams saying I should re-enter my details, but when I opened the app, it kept refreshing by trying to connect to the server... The pop-up kept glitching out and there was no screen to let me re-enter my new password linked to the account. I tried to sign out and uninstall, but the main login page didn't have a password field when selecting an existing email account."
Very bad
Ø§Ù†Ù‡ Ø³Ø¦ Ø¬Ø¯Ø§
"So ,, this application is very disappointing. I have submitted my assignment before the due date. Then, my teacher told me that I hadn't turned in my assignment. I was very upset at that time, remembering I had sent my assignment. Then, when I look at my assignments in the assignments menu, I actually see that the assignments were not delivered and were overdue. I actually sent my assignment. Please improve this application. I am very disappointed by this this damage. 2 stars."
Why is there not a create account option?
Chat option seems to be disabled for certain devices. Am not able to chat within a meeting from my Honor 20 whilst a colleague is able to from his Samsung.

Improvement
"It was good for a few months, but now I am having immense trouble in joining meetings. It always says 'We couldn't complete the call.' I reckon Google meet is much better"
"Unnecessary animations, not synced to desktop app, need to restart the app for switching to dark mode, notification do not show the current msg received. Poorly made."
Good day. I downloaded the app just awhile and it seems that I can't present PowerPoint nor pfd files via share function. It says here that it's the latest version but I can seem to use it properly. What is this?
Sharing documents is very very difficult
Good
Noise
"Every time you start this app ,it will hang for 10-15 min .Waste of time and energy"
This app is good but when I am logining so it's showing that it is wrong password but it's right and it's not good
Study and study

How to update teams

"This is a waste app if done in online classes, there is always a prob ðŸ™„"
ðŸ‘
This was really useful in my online classes. Some essus were there but mostly it was really really useful .
Good
Audio video goes off frequenly. Live classes become haywire Its irritating.
After every 10 to 15 minuites it says team ist risponding and when i again open the app there are to many glitches in this app im not able to join my class please do something on this problem as soon as posible
"It's good but bad as consumes lot of data space,network and hangs a lot .It don't have chats option as well.The children who are studying in this app are facing lot of problems.The recordings of teacher gets disapear after every 20 days.I have to resart my network after every meeting.There always network problem sometimes it shows black screen and no buttons works, every day some of errors are found, sometime I can't see teacher face or something she is sharing on screen.Needs improvement... ðŸ˜„"
The call is getting ended up necessarily.
It is very buggy
I cannot log to my account
Kenapa saya punya team tidak ada team dlm tu yg dekat dgn bawah tu??
"I use it for my kids to communicate with schools for e learning, it's hard to find the assignments and we spent lots of time to find it, I don't know what happened but we didn't face this problems in previous semester!!"
Constantly different issues. Typical Microsoft.
"Poor imitation of zoom. With large meeting, everyone has to turn off video or it freezes for all. Hard to see who is on meeting."
I love this app
This is so best app
Recorded videos are not stored in chat history In mobile phone So please fix it the problem immediately I had missing my recorded classes
"I have been using teams for the past one and a half month. Teams provides many facilities for the meetings. However, the chat is irritatingly slow. It takes a lot of time to be delivered. I wish that you take some measures for the problem l have faced. Also, the application takes up a lot of memory and does not allow other apps to function while it is running."
Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø±Ù†Ø§Ù…Ø¬ Ù…Ø¹Ù‚Ø¯ ÙˆØ¨Ø±Ù†Ø§Ù…Ø¬ zoom Ø§Ø³Ù‡Ù„ Ù…Ù†Ù‡ Ø¨ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ±
Not that good .
This is the worst app to use
Can u bring virus in this app??
"Chats do not load up some times, messages are not being sent. Have to force close the app and open then every 1 hr else it wont sync up."
Classes have been going on since 2 months ago and everytime the same disturbance is there-muting and making attendee. Its a good app but it would be better if the person who is creating the disturbance his name is shown.
This app doesn't shows that who is muting anyone please bring an update because it's very annoying and making a disturbance
Good in terms of quality of call and sounds but there is quite a lot of problems and needs development so in next update please make a system that will show the names of those who are muting other participants or remove the muting option as it is making a pleasant meeting unpleasant. Then I can rate 5 stars
"This app is not thaaaat bad but it makes my device freeze and gives me atleast 10(!)ðŸ˜² errors a day . I do have to take my classes on it .It's really hard to take my classes as it signs me out on it's own .Whenever we have a test the app selects the wrong answers (like I didn't even pick those answersðŸ˜§ðŸ˜¡).I would really appreiate if this app would be fixed, as my school prefers this app.ðŸ˜‘"
I am not like this app .this app is waste .
This app is crasing in laptop Please rectify it as early as possible
Bugs everywhere. Suddenly tells me that i have been removed from my chat. No one has sone anything to my account. Confusion creater
It's so beautiful I like it. It's very help full
"Whenever you think ""it can't possibly get worse"", Microsoft rolls an update and things GET worse. I mean, it ever used to be buggy, especially with multiple workspaces (which is a common use case and just should work), but with the recent update it won't even start anymore. Two stars because it's actually nice IF it works..."
It's good that we can share work but network issues we can't turn on video ðŸ˜¬
My password was correct still it is showing incrct
Live screen not shearing
fnt7 the only 8th the first half of the p.o. to and including
Some meetings are not available for all When it is started by organizer the meeting shows eneded for someone but meeting is running
Excellent
Whenever we are in a meeting somone can easily remove you & it doesn't show who removed you .
I gave the app only 2 stars because it would frequently go black every 3-5 seconds not allowing me to view anything on share screen. Please fix this as soon as possible to make the app better
"The app is not letting me sign in , the screen is freezing"
Please improve connection because video is not proper working in class
Cannot run properly on old phones
veryveryveryverybaddbad
Video is not clear
This is brilliant app for online classes but i post only 2 stars because ye boht jada battery khata hai mere 40 min. Ke period mein is ne 9 percent battery ho gayi.
"This app take much network for uploading pdf , etc not really happy Or sad with this app it is okay ...."
I dont like this app because this app may more storage
It is a good application but sometimes i am having so many issues while my online sessions or lectures and having mic problem all the time please Microsoft fix this
Because Mike unmute itself
With the new update chat box is unable in the phone (idk about the laptop) and more glitches have occurred
Wlaaa
I like the previous update the new one is so annoying and it atomatically opens on my desktop
Blah blah Blah.
The app is good. But the thing which troubles is muting . Please see to it . Make the app like that it cannot mute or can show the one who mutes .
"Don't give good interfere nce for learning,. There should be thumb options , And better chatting during lectures"
Good app for conducting classes
It is not updating
sant me the code of Microsoft team of 5 class and 7 class
Please do something somebody is muting and are class is being disturbed and our teacher is also very worried so please bring a facility in which if somebody mutes anyone his or her name will display that this person mute has muted this person. Please do it .
This app doesn't show who is muting or removing please bring an update about it. His or her name should be shown
"Everytime someone muting a participant in our class and it is only showing ( muted by meeting ) pls update it so it will show the muting person's name, plss our class is being pranked by pranksters"
We were facing a lot of problem because someone was muting us continuously for which reason we were getting distracted many times in our class. Please bring an update which shows the person who has muted whom like google meet. Please.
Nice app ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ But its not add 1 more childðŸ‘Ž
it is kicking me out of meating when my mobile is close
Its good
Hate itt. Even hate my college with it.
Bluetooth option doesn't show many times even when device is connected
Worst not good
Automatically opening and closing the app. Have to force stop all the time..
Thiss appp is worsttt butt after this also i gave this app 2 star because it is helping a lot in this lockdown period
Nice app
It's just like a video calling app
This app is very good for study
Good
The icon ( teams ) does not appear for me what I will do ?
"New update is just worst!!! Yes I'm talking about that feature that now recorded videos are not save in streams, if someone have to watch it he/She would have to download every recording.. Earlier it use to automatically save in streams. Please bring that feature back it was very beneficial for students who watch their lecture. We can't download every meeting recording of more than 150MB. Bring that back!!!!!!!!!!"
"I keep getting a notification saying ""you have a teams notification"" on my phone for no apparent reason and when I click the notification it prompts me to sign into teams even though I was already signed in. Once I sign in (again) there are no notifications. The app is just stuck in a refresh loop and never actually refreshes unless I go to another tab like ""files"" and go back to chat. Also, pdf and word files won't work anymore after an update. Now I need to download the files and open external"
"Feels heavy, under windows works ok but not all options work cross-platforms."
It taking more than 5 to 7 minutes to open and it not working properly everytime i had complaint many time then also the process is not becoming good.
In laptop its work better But in phone it would work good. It doesn't show all the members view at a same time.â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸â˜º........
"This is a best app...As it helps in my studies..But sometimes during the meeting calls, it stops working.. And while chatting, during calls ,,it stops ..ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” ... Sometimes it doesn't open.."
Good App But Sometimes The video quality is worst
i dont know why you're asking a student to do vertification
Does not support Bluetooth audio properly. Speaker mode uses proximity sensor for no apparent reason.
Ok
I hate it
Sometimes the call gets dropped by itself
Have many bud
Good but in the meetings voice cracks video is blur but the options are really amazing
Coz i experience lag
Keeps dropping my call every 10 seconds.
Sign in nahi hota isne bekarr app ghatiya
Its working efficiently
It was more fecillities but some speakee and annoyes sound
"There is a login issue which is worst, also this app needs better network speed"
Video ðŸ“¹ is strucking change video ðŸ“¹ quality
"Initially I was able to add two of my business Account using 'Add account' option under Teams app Menu. But now if I sign in to one of the accounts and try to add the other one it gives me an error saying the second one doesn't exist under the Server of first account. These two accounts are of different businesses, hence different servers. It was working fine before, has started giving me this error now!"
Very very bad application
Please remove the Reconnecting tone.... It's irritating
the most expired app
Good
Vr.slow dome time
It needs a lot of networkðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Good
It's does not have game
Nice
"The app is good for online classes and all but my main problem is that I cannot upload my assignments on time and it always uploads aftr the given time, it happens like this everytime so please fix this"
"I only rate this 2 star because in my android it lags so much and sometimes the sound and screen is also not visible,The audio is glitchy,Screen freezes OOF!!! WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU TAKE ACTION,Otherwise this app is fineðŸ˜‡"
This is not a good app this apps chat box is not there
It's good but can you add option like if we forgot password we can reset it
Somewhat unsatisfactory....!!!
Chal
After the last update my calls get closed on it's own and restarts unexpectedly . I really wasn't expecting this.
Low voice quality Low video quality Slow app Please improve this quickly
Overall the experience is good But it would've been better if they update the interface for tablets. We're not able to read chats along with watching video lectures in tablets.
"It has a good experience overall but for some reason I haven't been able to open the chat in the meetings for days now, it says error, and because of it I couldn't participate in many polls, it's very annoying, I hope you fix this issue quickly because my lectures are being conducted on this app."
Exceptionally Good app for teaching
It does open sometime.
Not bad
2 stars cuz not user friendly and cannot reset password
I love so much
Not good we have to always sign up and takes a lot of time
Sometime need to open laptop in order to join a meeting by phone ( if I can open laptop no need apps d) Some of the meeting need to reopen the app in order to get inside....
The new version of the app has very good look but the reason for giving only 2 stars is because in this version when I have joined the meeting the chat box is showing that you're no longer participent Plese try to improve this
Why i can't download it? If i install after 100% it will go back again to install. Why is that?
Voice is not coming while in meeting and video is not also clear or sometimes cannot see the video. And my network connection is too goodðŸ˜Ž. I'm having a 4G sim.
Better
I am a student
Good app bc
"Had high hopes from the description and really did give a shot. It's really lacking in flexibility and granular configuration. Only 3 categories, personal, work, uncategorized. That should absolutely be configurable. Family, spam. Etc..... Swipe actions are rigid and direct opposite of how all my other apps are configured. Makes it so I block all my contacts because of muscle memory. Lots of other little annoyances that really have no reason to be so. Moving on..."
"Smooth but a I have an annoying problem, so i'm on the chatbox, in class, and even though I am looking at the chatbox, the notifications still come I can't chat anything when the teacher asks a question cause I have to ""X"" everyone's reply. Please change this, I can see the chatbox and the name of the person who's chatting, I don't want to see Jimmy Burton's reply twice! I already know he sent a reply, I'm looking right at it! I don't need all these chat notifs."
"Unreliable, distorted, there are other options."
"Usually, I love this app- it allows me to complete my school work, attach files etc. However, recently, it has been playing up- every time I press a file that has been attached by my teachers in a team, it tells me that something has gone wrong.."
Installed the app works just like the desktop version but I can't find the files at all ðŸ˜’
My chat section disappeared from today idk what happened but i am losing a lot of attentence pl fix it But in laptop it does not happen
"I have to take online classes, because of this app. But i am giving two stars because i can bunk all classes while using this app."
Tty
I dont know what is the glitch but my professor said he added me on a team but there was no notification and further more there is no team option showing..ðŸ™ðŸ™
Can't join video conferences. Keeps on freezing and shutting down.
Many basic features are missing and need more optimization. Zoom is good when compared.
Nice app
Good
My headset jbl is not working.. But it works for all other apps.. After the updation its happening.. Tell the solution please.. Its very difficult to take online classes..
I am facing problem in downloading this app.. Resolve issue asap
The app is not that much appreciable because it shows a lot of glitches and it either stops working showing a message 'Unfortunately teams has stopped'.... I bought a new phone for my class but still this app is not satisfactory. ... Please do work upon it.
OMG it takes muchh time to signin ..about three hours i am trying to sign in but it is misbehaving
New update is the worst but I like that now we can see 6 screens at a time
"Admin has disabled chat... The Android version is having a problem which displays a message admin as disabled chat for this user. This is displayed to the users within the organisation as well. Microsoft creates so many user profiles for the same person that ultimately he will be perplexed. When scheduling meeting through Outlook when you go to meeting options it suddenly blocks you saying "".... ."" is not authorized to edit the meeting. Only the meeting owner can edit.."
The app I've s not opening and it showing can't sign in
Nice to office use
Functionality seems to have been reduced recently. I'd like to be able to control notifications and set quite hours.
"It's not supporting me to open, due to my two different mobile numbers"
Good
I can't download this in my phone.
No Show Background Effects on some laptops
"Frequently signs out randomly. Also randomly opens the app, could be scrolling photos or texting someone and suddenly the teams app opens and I have to close it to go back to what I was doing."
Satisfactory
"It was very nice before update but after update it is the worst app, there are more glicthes than my meeting, very sad."
This app is very hardly to use. This app is very bad app. I say do not use this app. This is too much bad this app have many many hard settings so you don't download this app. That is your and my responsibility.ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
Good but not well
"This aap has a good security , but shows the notification late .even if the class is goin on it doesn't shows that the meeting has started."
Good app
The option for headset is not working and I am not able to use bluetooth headset in this app only normal earphones are working ðŸ™„which distracts a lot....there are lot of glitches in this app
à¤˜à¤Ÿà¤¿à¤¯à¤¾app
When I use this app to watch recorded video in wifi it start to buffer.so please solve this issue or I m gonna use other platform. But one thing is good that it works in poor network.Therefore I am giving it 2 star....please solve this issue soon....
"Many glitches, lags a lot both in android and windows. Have many usefull features but need refinement."
android users also want virtual background useless without virtual background ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±
Most of the functionalities are not working properly on my Samsung tab E. It says it is not compatible with this device.
Good but some technical problem during classes
Good app but this app use very much data
Not so good not so bad
Recorded video is not coming please sought this probem
I have been using this app for a while now (for online school) but today when i checked to see what my teacher sent me the chats are now disabled So i dont know what im going to do now because this device im using right now is the only device i have teams on please get the chats back
It's not that good
"Can't sign in it takes forever to sign in I wait for hours and still count get sign in I have a valid Microsoft team account for my school, so I tried another phone and just work but on this phone is just won't let me sign it"
"Switching between accounts has been my biggest issue. I haven't been able to use it successfully with a personal and work account. It crashes or forces me to use one over the other. When I log out of my work account, the app forces the login when I open it again. I just decided uninstalling was the best option."
Masseges dont sync properly with desktop app. There is random delays between the two
"What the app is capable of doing is awesome. It's consistency in doing so is terrible. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a number of times, and it constantly glitches. If I didn't have to have it for work now, there is no way I would use it."
It doesn't work well
If you simultaneously login both jn mobile and computer for a call computer call gets to hold unlike Cisco app webex can be used simultaneously in both with same user
Mobile app asked you to travel in time. Backwards. It won't show any updates or changes in your groups for days.
I have a lot of trouble logging my four-year-old granddaughter on to her pre K teams meeting in the mornings sometimes it connects sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just leaves you waiting in the lobby
Outlook crashing while scheduling teams call
"Teams needs to work to be more compatible with Chromebooks. On my Chromebook, I cannot share my screen and I also cannot go through presentation slides with coworkers without the slides moving through on their own."
For me it asks for login everyday
Features are good but the app is facing many glitches. Next learning platform is better than this
Its a very poor application from Microsoft. Didn't expected that. Its really cumbersome to present screen on this app. Presentation quality is also very poor. Screen keeps freezing. Also unable to connect more than one device in a meeting. Moved from Zoom to Teams...now moving back to Zoom again. Hope so Microsoft solve these issues in future.
"I am a learner so my challenges are related to my level of proficiency. Will be really enjoyable once I master Teams. Since I am a LECTURER, I need to integrate it with MOODLE LMS and then I believe it will be thrilling!!"
Mobile app stuck my mobile and more battery consume
"I give you 2 stars because it is smooth and easy to use. But please in the next update can you please add custom background for video calls, I will rate 5 stars in the next update."
"Given two stars because the app for some time it shows everything but , after that it willl show only the meeting schedule, some error occur in joinig the meeting and the file section also washed away after some period of time"
Very heavy app.. makes the mobile slow.. takes too much time.. Skype is way better than this.
"It's a sophisticated app,yet it is not very much appreciable. It hangs a lot.Evn my classmates say the same."
There isn't a chat option for participants who are using mobile to join meetings. Files that are shared through MS Teams are sometimes not available and the app is too slow. Please fix those glitches ASAP.

Super
"Very frustrating to use. Any time something is somewhat close to the top of my phone it turns the screen off, and there's no way to disable this. I'd highly appreciate it if this feature became optional or is removed entirely"
Kon kon base collage ka student ha bachoo

The old version was better the new version is the worst i cant excess the recorded mettings on my phone or tablet
It is a very useful app. But there are many problems. Sometimes my voice is not audible during meetings though my microphone is working. I tried all the ways to solve it but nothing worked. This makes the app very irritating. Please resolve this issue.
Good
It is useful during my online class
"Hey Microsoft, there is a problem in new update. We can't see recordings of meeting in our phone. I could see it in before latest update, but not now. So please fix it.â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸"
It's getting stop while sharing the screen before it was not lik that.
NO CHAT OPTION AT ALL ASWELL AS NO SHARE SCREEN OPTION.....WASTE
Can't use a Bluetooth headset.It connects to phone but in the meeting the option of Bluetooth is not showing.Other apps are working good with my headset but only teams is not working.
Its is not so good
It is awesome it help in chatting Or attending the class in lockdown classes in it have assiments to do but some time it automatically disconnected ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
Many times my call use to be disconnected and even there is a fast internet connection. I use to attend online class through this but this creates a lot of problems.And today it is not even connecting with the class. This problem is faced by many students over there.ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
File sharing not working properly. Reciver cant show or listen picture and sound togather.
Excellent service from teams
I'm now giving only 2 star rating because the recording versions are missing... Even though we recorded the data after some time the recordings are missing... This problem appears after updating the app so please fix this problem and provide a solution...thank u

So I have give 2 stars now....bcoz no response.....
Good
"The app is good for online lectures but has a lot of issues on Android. There is a lag in document display. The presenter would be on a different page but it will show a different page. Also sometimes the audio is very faint, you have to press your ear againt the speaker to hear."
Pls how can i retrieve a forgotten password
It's extreme glitchy and non-responded when I video chat in class.
Sound and visuals are very intermittent
I cant log in please helpðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ
Not good
But need break our rooms for group activity.need same options like zoom. In that way it lacks many.
Poor
"This is a good app for interactive meetings, but the sound quality through the app can be better, so I opt. to call in by phone for better sound."
"M Teams android app sucks, better use the desktop version"
Please make this app movable to SD card storage as it is taking up alot my my Samsung J5's internal storage up.it is the most memory intensive app on my device at the moment please do something about this!
The presentation size is not good. It shows in small size. And also not able to see properly. But also sound quality is good
I will give it 2 stars because the saved lecture is not availabe like this message i get always plz do something for this
Keeps prompting a 'slow connection' error and contents update very slowly. This happens even when there's no issue with data connection.
"In live meeting ,we can't share video through video share option, video not showing in clouds or saved memory .someting same happened with powerpoint presentation files but after some days it's shown."
good
"It works well for calls and has a relatively nice user interface, not too difficult to navigate , but generally the notifications from the built in chat feature are extremely unreliable. Sometimes the chat notifications only come through when I open the app. This has gotten me in to trouble several times, because I miss messages from colleagues . For this reason I give it 2 stars, because an app focused around communication should be effective at notifying and keeping its user up to date."
Screen sharing is hazy on phone. Everyone just appears garbled irrespective of the connection type. This happened after the recent update. Please fix.
This app is the worst app...! It was so blurry...and voice was also breaking...even when i have much internet....! Worst app
Google meet better Microsoft teams worst vido conferencing app Google meet is the best
sometimes Hanging
If we have to sign up it is very difficult let it be easy and good.
Not user friendly
"Phone speaker audio output becomes unusably low sometimes. The ""Tap to return to meeting"" option on the notification screen doesn't work. So many other usability bugs are present that it's a shame to be coming out from Microsoft."
Not allowing me to sign in
We are not having an individual chat ðŸ’¬
This app is taking very space but it is good
Because I am opening this app it was not opening
We are not able to upload quiz file
Facing Poor vedio quality even the internet speed is good
"It was a very bad app ,developers are not a bit talented."
I like to this app.
Good
Those app is good but there are so much of network problem
"This app has a lot of bug. When ever I open this app my mobile starts hanging. This problem is not only hangs my mobile, due to this app my desktop also starts hanging. Due to this bas app my many files also gets deleted, not only this due to this my laptop and mobile both sometimes gets switched off. This uses all of my battery life in just 2 hours. I am a student and I have to do class till 4 hours. Microsoft please do something."
It was great first without new update s but now this app glitches a lot and I have to reopen it every time .My internet works perfectly well and there is no issue in it please fix this.
Can that we chat privately is seen by others
Very bad
Boring
This is aap is not very good i don't understand how to do anything in this aap i give it only 2 stars
It require strong net connection
Worst app I ever seen
Good
Very nice app
Audio and video quality is good but consumes a lot of net and always show reconecting plzz fix this
Good meeting
This costs money that's all
I really hate this app for only one problem I have network issues on laptop and then I take classes on phone an icon always irritates me in the screen please remove that icon your app will be the best app if you remove the icon on right side it blocks the screen I really hate that thing
App is good but require high speed internet which is not possible everywhere
Good app but not very good
I am give it 2 stars only because when I try to join classes it just won't open it completely become black and can't even sign up it says this is not you password or email Id.....
It is a good app but a lot more complicated
Bad play
Crashed on my android every 5 mins.
Rajni sudha So poor app always use to hang. Can't do a single class also properly. Update option also not come weekly.
"Slow connection detected, it takes longer time than usual. This error is regularly popped up and couldn't sign in"
Its hanging to much....uploading files system is not too good
its good but it is logging..I wanted report about it
"Whenever i open the app it says that i have slow connection and can't refresh and show me the latest feed. When i used the website on my laptop connected to the same ""slow"" connection, everything works fine. Please fix this bug ASAP as i have important webinars being held nowadays on this platform"
"Lot of issues. I'll name top two. 1. Whenever you open the app, it automatically goes to office 365 in the browser. Super annoying. 2. You cannot add someone out of your organization while creating a meeting invite. It can't be done from outlook app as well as it doesn't give ms teams option. One is left with no option but to do it from thier desktops. Do something about this...."
It's not so good. The presented content is not visible even if the network is quite good. The video is also not visible. I don't know when u r going to improve this problem??? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Not as per expectation
THIS IS BEST APP
I'm using this for school and I need it on my phone but it says I can't I have freed up space and did everything else but still won't install. And since this won't install I might be getting more F's bc I can upload anything on this device nor the computer
"The new update is just not worth updating, post the update the app runs slow, it takes longer for a message to be received and have to refresh to know if there was any notification that was missed."
It wasn't great I had a lot of problems with it loads of glitches and a lot of the time I couldn't attend meetings because of the terrible quality of the call.
It used to work fairly well but after the new update it is driving me nuts or rather it is acting crazy. I am being logged out and not getting options to share. Please fix it.
Nice
First i have given 5out of 5 but that i am giving onlg 2 because i was log out my teams and relogin again for my online vlasses it showing Id and password incorrect
I can't find chats option. Google Meet is better.

"Extremely confusing. I have a chromebook for school and we were assigned to use teams to get in touch with our teachers and classmates. Everyone could see each other's faces but me. My teacher said that they were all in gallery mode, but I had it to where the person speaking was up on the screen. I checked the three-dots where my teacher told me to look, but all I saw was keypad, enter full screen, stop incoming video, etc. I need to know how to go on gallery mode on a chromebook for school."
It was good at first but now its just slow

Please solve this problem"
This app uses a lot of battery and data. It is on the top in the list of data draining apps .
Good app Visibility of the video is not good The app is not user-friendly It somtimes gets hang during the meetings Can be better......

Teams app is niice convinient and helpful. Buts it uses a lot of mobile data.
Nice
veerry bad
This app is very helpful to my online classes
Teams won't stop asking me to give feedback for the app unless I agree to do it. So you get 2 stars for annoying me
Audio issues during calls when speaker is turned on. No such issue when using other services like webex
"I cannot get to display any file stored in the file section of channel, I keep getting ""that is odd no preview available"""
"Changed to 2 stars because of MAJOR messaging issue: replies in the message notification section WHILE NOT ALREADY IN THE APP are literally being sent TO THE WRONG PERSON/GROUP. Unfreaking acceptable & embarrassing to have private conversation broadcast to large group. Also, turned on dark mode by itself. USED TO generally be reliable. Getting this kind of app right is difficult, but some problems can't happen. Getting bumped out of meetings in the middle of them is fairly common on all devices"
I donnt like it bcz i used this for but before school i loved the app
Good experience but i am facing problem since 3 days that i put a video lecture on recording but when the lecture is finished the microsoft dont provide the recording kindly solve this so that i can give 5 stars!

Not be than batter but I have given 2 star â­

Sir after updating app recorded video stopped to come and some of recorded video doesn't run. Please solve my problem. Otherwise it is all good app
Now the teams is working nice...! But now its again starting CALL DROPPED...! Few files are not opening...?
"Teams won't start, instead cycles between several screens, won't even shut down without restarting device."
Constantly getting stuck on loading messages on startup.
good
"Looks like the last update was not very well. Every couple of minutes Teams suddenly disappears and your work is gone. I'm not sure whether introducing Teams in schools will lead to learning, except learning that (not mathematical validated) ""software will crash and your work will be lost"". Making backups will help, but those will be on paper then or using another software and doing only copy & paste to Teams - this is not user friendly!"
Very low quality
Its good but sometimes it does not let me join and I have to reinstall again and again
I can't access the homework they put to do oline
Good
Its good app but the main problem is files which are sent by our teachers ever open .It take lot of to open or mostly it never openðŸ˜­ This is very much irritating.
Cant do a call and no call icon.
This app always want my password and I am not able to listen the audio and only 9 students can switch on the video and the video starts freezing and the voice starts echoing not very good not very bad 4 star given from my side but should given 3 stars today I was doing my online classes it was hanging and hanging and I could not take my class at all it was worst worst worst

Whenever I join a meeting my screen comtinously flickers and goes out.It's really a nuisance.Fix it please.
Most of the times ppl cant join in
I wonder why no smart TV edition since more convenient for meeting or even online school..
"Mic turns on for no reason even tho it says that its of before joining and before the class starts I thought that the mic is of but turns out its not, and I was speaking something personal and please do fix it cause it happen lots if times."
"Buggy. Camera doesn't work. Just logging in requires a bunch of personal information. A note: dear Microsoft. You are yesterday, please back off the data collection and just accept that you will forever be the second option."
Delete account option not available
Decent

I would give it zero it doesn't work in some mobile and it will close by itself in between meetings it works very good in laptop but in mobile it does not work good
How to change profile pic Because there is no option to change.
Good
Well it's good but there exist some glitches like.... the unexpected stopping of app and inability to work along with the other apps . I look forward for an improvement.

Lots of bugs in Private Conversations. Can't see Messages for a while. Can't delete a conversation !! MS need to fix those bugs
Chatia app
The new update is the worst. Gave 2 stars for the sake of previous version. Everyone I know using MS Teams have been facing a lot of glitches. The chat options are now disabled. The recording of the meeting needs to be downloaded separately now. Sharing documents have become more difficult. The recorded meetings are now going to be expired (every 20 days). Pls work one this else it will create the worst impression. Pls make the necessary changes. Thank you.
Ok ok
Good
A really useless app..it took me 2 weeks just to login in to the app. It made my phone hang always ...
This app asks again and again to re sign and i am muted in this team And also i am not presenter in meeting i am attendee always in meeting and people are removing me from the meeting and we are not able to know that who are removing me .it asks again and again password . In between
Not bad not good mediumðŸ™‚
It kinda works
Would have rated better but using this app on my mobile since sometime and facing issue at the time of screen sharing. If there is just one person on call with me and if that person is sharing the screen then it is not properly visible. The screen appears in slanting position. Bit if there are more people on call and if the screen is shared by the other person then the screen is properly visible. Discussed this with some of my colleagues and even they are facing this issue. Need to fix this.
It's too bad
Keeps popping up and asks me to sign in without me starting the app.
Beginner.Not seeing calender tab in my teams Android app.. What should I do.. id used to login is official gmail.account
Very badðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜
Dont speedly connect meeting
Very poor app never functions properply and especiall logs me out everyday and worst part it has a lot of during early part of day. It often laggs.
Once you forget your I'd there is no way to recover it if mobile no is not set. Can't u just use normal Gmail I'd ðŸ˜  I would prefer Google meet
Unable to re authenticate after getting logged out Meeting didn't open after tapping join from the notification
App is good but zoom is better
"Whenever I open the app from my phone, it keeps on asking for login time and again, even after updating the app. Kindly resolve this issue."
"There is a loop hole while conducting exams on teams, someone gave the test on my name and when the results came teacher gave me his marks as it was submitted before i submitted my paper. Please see to it. Teams id and password must be required for giving the test not just name and class."
Bad app zoom is the best or Google meet .my school is following this app only it has several problems sometimes anybody can't see others video and video is slow in pc or laptop sometimes we can and it is too tough to login in ms teams in school account totally it is good only not super since I have only teams for my online videos I request me to be more beeter and add virtual background for tab and phone.
Easy to use but the chat icon on call some time doesn't display in web version
Add delete option in chat
Good
"Not a Good app, Cannot put a Background also. Connectivity issues also and those FCM Test Notification are the worst. Got 16 of them. I will give it 2 stars"
Nice
It's giving more error in machine
Useless app kuch chalta to hai hi nahi online classes ke liye sabse bekar app
My internet is fast and then also videos are blur and audio is poor

"Hello Microsoft, I am Parthi every day I am doing online classes but I want a feature, this feature is only on laptops or computers I want tha background feature I want this feature on my mobile phone also so kindly add this feature on every mobile There are so many people who want this feature on their own mobile phone"
So difficult to open mad app worst app insane app etc.....zoom app is very easy but our school want this app i don't know why might be they like the compound one
Neither very nice nor very bad ok types
Good
Ok
Bad app
This is boaring app. PleaseðŸ™ do not download this app
Hi ! I use teams for my online classes and so I always update it but after 2 or 3 update I saw that the teams background was all black and it is not at all looking nice!!!ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
"Unfortunately, f"
It's a good app but this app can't support my Bluetooth wireless headphones when I am connecting with headphones then I can't able to hear anyone voice please do something
You should allow mobile users to use banner/announcement
A good app but calender is not coming
This is good for the students and the school management to take the online classes but the thing past one week there is a problem with meet recordings those recordings saved by the teacher's arent able to open it.. please rectify it properly.. make sure the recorded videos are available for a long term .. it says the recording will be expired in 20 days.. and also this 20days option isnt available in the mobile ph. Its only there in the pcs.. plesse do the needful to us..
App still loading
"Buggy, needs plenty of work . Not sure why it's very overrated..."
Good app
The chat history is restricting to couple of lines and older ones getting disappeared automatically.
Group calling and video call keep having issue..Sound eco issue
I need to be the presenter
"Always getting an error - you are no longer participant, need to add and remove the account"
Getting a lot of unwanted notifications: FCM Message: Testing notification from Microsoft... I have got more than 6 notification message in the last hour. Is it something the user has to be concerned about?
"Overall decent app but runs into random problems too often. Recently been constantly getting ""FCM Messages"" . God knows what crazy nonsense Microsoft is up to. Also when you tap a message from the notification it never takes you to the chat window. Seriously needs more work when it comes to getting the basic stuff working seamlessly"
The app gave too many test notifications today on 27 August.. what's going on? Hired a junior developer to handle the teams app?
"Please do your testing yourself, don't spam in the notifications. Thanks."
"Please add the feature that the person who is removing me from meeting, his name will be displayed on screen instead of someone. Someone remove me from classes and I can't know that who is removing"
Overall good. Recently the app is sending a lot of test notifications. Will update rating once fixed.
"I have edited my review cuz this app has been glitching alot lately, it hangs and I have to restart all over again, I have reinstalled it multiple time and still have been facing the same problem. And let me tell this I have updated it to the latest version. The features are really good and easy to use. Other than the glitch and hanging inbetween everything's good.."
"I've been getting testing notification from microsoft non-stop from earlier this morning, whappen????"
Little good
Didn't work from ms Outlook
I am giving this app two star because this app this very much mobile data. My online classes are from 8:30 to11:00 this app take 50 present of data THANKS (PLEASE IMPROVE THIS APP) ðŸ˜¡ðŸ“±ðŸ˜¡ðŸ“±
"Had to update my review... Removed two stars. I was hoping this application would get better with time but it is not. It is still very buggy. I often find myself wishing we could go back to our previous communication software. Bugs: 1-Random crashes 2-Answering a call with a Teams Certified headset, the audio goes through the phone instead of the headset. 3-Delay(3-4 seconds) between answering a call and getting audio Could go on but not enough space to list it all..."
Good
Audio over Bluetooth headphones is very bad....audio cuts from time to time... It's so bad that the app is almost unusable with Bluetooth headphones..... Please fix that
It is not getting installed
Okay
"app is too good no doubt, but the auto change status feature is too bad...didm't like it...."
"It was great at first but for some odd reason it deleted all of my work and classes, I uninstalled and reinstalled and they got back but now they're gone again, can you fix this? Okay, it's a day later and now it's showing me work that isn't mine, please fix this!"
"It consumes too much data. 400Mb for 25 minutes in a 1-2-1 meeting! There is no option to have low resolution or any similar data saver option. And switching off my camera does not help much either. This is a killer for those working from home on personal mobile plans without WiFi, it burns our data plans in less than a week."
"It was fantastic. Not sure what happened, but now, the notifications are messed up and cannot connect to Bluetooth during calls."
It is very nice app
Audio not clear nd video lag for 5 to 10 second late display
"Some serious issues - 1. Voice memos don't open half the time, even on 4G. While whatsapp is working. 2. If chat  messages are not sent because of network issues, Then the messages are not automatically sent out when there is network.  I await a reply and check the next day only to find the message has not been sent and the app wants me to INDIVIDUALLY RESEND EACH MESSAGE?! 3. Why do I have to reply to myself when writing on teams? Every line creates a new topic as the default. Useless."
"The app works fine but after a while of using it, it just starts to freeze and none of my phone buttons work. Samsung Galaxy S10"
taking more network
It doesn't let me in from Android App. Just says sigining in ......
The application is great but will it ever be possible for an android phone to access the class materials icon?
APP deleted until FCM Test Notification can be explained and/ or resolved.
It must have a system for sending notes and other documents
Managing different groups is quite complex and the group to which a notification belongs is not specified.
"Used it a handful of times over the last 3 months and logged off in between but Teams popped up on the screen several times a day asking to log in. From today, despite being logged off I received 8 notification to test a new feature! If it wasn't for the above I would continue using the app and I woulnd't uninstall it."
Please stop sending test notifications for god's sake. I am not even a beta tester. My company pays you for the service.
"Several problems. Bluetooth headset is not recognized on Android 10.1, Huawei mate (works well with other apps). Sometimes when I join a meeting the sound is strongly crackling, which stays like that for the duration of the meeting. The notifications (at least in channels) don't seem to work, even if they are explicitly activated."
"My handset keeps crushing on the app,techno handset"
This device not enough not good the video quality is not so good but the bug's are in this device so you improve this device
please fix one bug when we are trying to join a call it is saying you could not add
It is ok i used it for school and everyone would talk over each other and mute each other
Cannot sign into my account. Keeps saying internet connection is not working while it's clearly on and is working for literally every other app.
App is good but the char seems to be bugged in android application. The chat doesn't scroll to bottom automatically. You'll have to manually scroll it every time and it's so frustrating.
Video recording not working properly for some reason
lot of Network essu
Good but some problem.
it ia not downloading
Okaish
All the things are good but when we are sharing screen its doest show the notification of new people who want to enter in meeting. If its slove this and show the notifications it will best among all other applications ..
This app is so important app to study . So this app is so so so so so so so much nice
It has no option for chat but t his app is good
Volume is very low . Overall video quality is good
It is fair
Can't sing in my phone
Very good experience as this consist of good features and also with the security of Microsoft corporation but i am giving 2 stars because it automatically start in my mobile without linking the app or opening it through any ID for the meeting or to start a meeting by myself so i request you please fix this so that the app wouldn't suddenly start and can be worked easily. And when i connect with my Bluetooth headphones it actuvate the sensor of reciever and my screen gone off please fix it.
Hangs many time for each meeting I have to install it again
The other side can't see my video
I want a system whatever the teacher reads becomes a book
"I am having issue with teams for samsungm21, whether I click on notification of teams like any chat notification app will not open it will be white screen"
Nice
Worst app my password can't be reset i know my password when i entered it said that your password is incorrect
Bad video quality. While video calling.
It's not bad
"In SHIFTS, if 'clock out' time is next day and you want to edit to previous date then it'll show error as [clock out time can't be less than clock in time] even if time is greater than clock in time Date & time will not get update"
Come on
Improve app feature Any attendee leave anytime automaticaly Host cant unmute attendee Host cant manage mute unmute by order
Give the option to change name in groups
"App logs automatically out every time I close the app, even though my phone is set to remember password and ""remember me"" was set... It also gives me notifications when there's no new messages when I log in. This is annoying!"
Hi sir i have an issue on audio calling.. The opposite people voice hearing clearly but my voice not audible to them.. Please help me to clear the issue..
Ok
Glitches really disturb a lot during important meetings otherwise all other features are really very impressive....
I can't upload my home work.
Bad
Every new update is making the app worse
Ss
Y are u giving permission for schs
It was good for online classes but few crazy people removes you from meeting. we don't know who removes you? that makes irritating.please give an update that will show who removes you from meeting
Not good because of the network issues and apply background to .
poor display of classÛ” we can't change our password also. so I can't like it

They mostly ask for the password or the ID. Pls solve this.
I am not able to sign in my work account.

The app does not work properly some time . Student can't join in class through whatsapp sometime. And calander also not work properly. When I set a class in calander it doesn't show in student's calander in teams. When I share link through ms teams it doesn't show in student's channel sometime. Please solve this problem.
Only good app
Happy
I was kicked out the hole time
I like it â˜ºï¸
App laggy sometimes. Add this features to improve app. 1. Add floating cameras like picture in picture mode. 2. Students should adjust video call as their want like expand or shrink only one member. 3. Add more resolutions in recorded videos. With hope of improving thank you.
"I would've given 5 stars but I feel that there's still a room for improvement. Please include chatbox option for mobile phones and I think UI interface especially for notification area can be made more smooth and features that are not usable should be discarded. Also, please allow us to move files to folder using phone also."
Good aap but still we are facing some problems like the screen is sometime not shared then we have to shift back to the zoom
My app is not installing
Super
It's very nice and cool
Is good
Horrible app. It can't hold a candle to MSN Messenger tbh. It's so unintuitive compared to Slack or traditional irc apps.
Worst bcz of online classesðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜†
Not nice
Son was told download this for doing homework through glow but has no idea how to log in at all the log in page doesnt offer much help either and Microsoft teams isnt supported on any browsers on phones or tablets quite useless since everyone owns a phone but not everyone has the space for downloading apps
The big Fault of the app is that the app could not show who one does mute you and Who one person Remove you from meeting . This is more disturbance fault of the app . My feedback for the app is To Make it showable.
Pixel 4 XL with Pixel Buds 2 - Teams does not recognize when buds are activated while you're on a teams call. Does not add bluetooth option to the speaker icon.
Nice ... !! Great more secure than zoom !!
Bad
It stopped working
latest update not working properly shared video not displaying properly
"Very waste app , no Virtual background for mobile phone and tab"
Good
It's nice But sometimes screen becomes full black and can't help anything This is too much annoying Pls fix this problem
When I am using this app for listening online classes I observed that data consumption of this app was too high.......
â¤
"I was better if we could known that who has removed or muted us during a meeting. I hope microsoft will fix it. If there is like I said, the app will surely deserve a 5 star rating."
This is a nice app but i dont like the attendees there should be only presenters

When I click on the link, it turns to the next page showings the app symbol, but nothing happens after that so, I've to reinstall it after uninstalling due to which many times I get late in my meetings. I'm just frustrated coz of such blunders in this appðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•."
Op
I like this very much
The app does not respond at all
Very bad picture quality and unable to understand anything especially in mathematics class.
It takes too much internet
Cant see messages if someone memtion me.
2 star only because of mic glitch
This app is good but there is no privacy there the organisers can easily see your chat while in zoom app there is privacy
"I am just giving two starts for this app , because this is not very helpful app for taking online classes. This app don't show othes contact , we cannot talk privately . In zoom we can talk privately but in this app whenver we are taking to oir friend it's shown by teacher . Please fix this problem."
Worst app
"I am logged in with my University account to software version and web version in my PC, but this app at Store Repeatedly ask me for mail to enter but couldn't let me login at all."
Only works half the time
Please add the option to delete feed activities. Thanks!
Multiple issues using teams on my Google pxl phone. It wouldn't let me use the chat. Then I reinstalled it and cannot log in. Couldnt access support either
Not to reliable
"Cannot hear a team meeting audio if you look at the Teams chat or if you open another app while on a call. Zoom, Skype, and Facebook video chat can do that but this app isn't capable of it."
"Im unable to see whiteboard on my android device, which i can do on my laptop at the same time."
How to see files
Can't even load Assignments or Note book. Has a lot of bugs and lags.
Very bad vzdeo quality and inconsistent through a video session. No feature for background noise cancelatio very disturbing and irritating .
"It,s very long size app , it is conguming mobile data and this app take many RAM so I will give only 2 rating it,s not able for five rating . So I will request you you improve your microsoft team appðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ‘ŽâŒ"
Great app when it works
"It was so irritating that after arranging my snapshots orderly in the assignment twice ,it got jumbled again. I advice you all to never try this app. Developers should see into it as a matter of urgent importance."
Keeps changing user interface without prior warning. You have to look for where things are. Annoying. Can't bring someone calling into current conversation.
Ok
App doesn't work most of the time. It notifies internet is slow even wen 4G network is connected with proper network.
Good but consumes a lot of data and sometimes does not work properly....
Very heavy app not responding on andiriod .
Good
Please disable the remove option because during the class setion some participants are continuously removing other student even after they are prohibitated to do that
"Dear devlopers, Our college just introduced MS teams for online class, but notorious Students are using ""Remove the participant"" feature to kick out people from the meeting, and it is very much irritating. Please limit this feature to Host only, Or remove it. After that i'll rate u 5*"
Has some issues like screen freezing when turning into landscape mode and chat loading is slow af Also loading time sucks
"Some glitches in the app lately.. getting crashed frequently.. need to reinstall every time..even the PC version. In win 10, takes up huge chunk of RAM..."

"This app is Amazing For Chats but The Problem I gave 2 Star to it is that it Cannot be Move to External Storage It Doesn't made for Low end Devices After Login This File Data is About 300mb+ As it Takes Maximum usage Of Ram. On The Low end Devices Which Have 8Gb or 16Gb Rom And 2,3Gb ram Laggs And Heat... Atleast Please Made it To Move On External Storage"
Nice

Nice app for study live
Kabhi bhi stop ho jata hai . Kabhi bhi chalte chalte password mangna start kar deta hai
"It is a very nice app for education system during this pandemic. But I didn't like the feature that you can only see 8 people at a time, it must be like that ki you can see whom you want to see. And there is a problem not my connection problem bcoz I am having a good internet connection. Whenever I on my camera my class teacher couldn't see me ,this happens with other students also and ,that's why we are marked absent."
There was a chat box to chat but now it has been removed day by day the updates are getting bad and it was such a great app three months back but now it has ruined our life we need the update of the chat please fix it.
Had promlems with multi screens
This is My class app
Won't work at all with our adfs.
It really helpful
Teams on PC is usable. Teams on Android is not.
Half of the times messages are not sent while I can send messages on other apps or even watch videos. God know what bandwidth it needs in background but it's poorest app among any team collaboration apps
Good ðŸ™ðŸ™
Assianments are not comming please rectify it
Good
Its better
Nice app
I dont like this app..even the password written in it shows wrong when the password is right
Bedly experience
Samarth
Its nice and very helping app
"App Does Not Work in Background. Even when we go to Q & A menu, audio of the Speaker gets unable."
There should be an option of deleting chats.
Need lots of improvements
This was very bad experience because it stop whenever I start this app
"Super slow, very confusing and not easy to use.... The windows version is very bad"
its very immature with a lot of fairly basic functionality missing from the core product but the apps sharing is pretty good
App is frequently popping up in android any time
"I have to uninstall and reinstall this app every single time I want to look at my work schedule. The app is updated, as is my phone. Otherwise, Teams works great. I would give more stars if I didn't have the issue with the schedule."
Logged me out on my phone and I couldn't log back in!
Better
"Yes it is good only sometimes when its working properly......there is a hell of a trouble in logging in .... Very slow in its working.... Quality of calls is alright but the issue of echo and sound distortment is there... Content sharing is again very slow.....only using it because of my college. Now its not even signing in ... A message just shows ""cant sign you in"" . i have deleted and then reinstalled the app but still the problem persists. I dont know what the hell is the problem"
It very helpful app. From Childer also in school work
Not proper vedio when 2-3 turn their mike on rest it is ok but it always says that teams is not working please if you work on it I am sure it will the best application please
Good
Awesome
There should be option to delete the chats. All old chats just fills the whole page making it difficult for us to find some other chats which we want.
This app is helpful with online classes but there are some bad things. The audio is infront of the screen shared or video and some parts of the audio get skipped. The screen and video keep freezing and keep turning off unexpectedly. The audio and screen video have a huge delay between them. This app now doesn't work on IOS devices such as IPads. The app is very helpful but it could be better.
Bhala mana hav aavu hoy kay
If we can chat with other members privatly then it is perfect meeting app
Horrible experience in the meeting the chat box is not appearing in mine but rest have the chat box. It has to improve a lot
I would have given it full stars if the app will give the features in mobile also that They can change background during video is on my ward studies online from this app but cannot change background although this app is good but you should work on my opinion

Unable to download easily
good but sometimes it was not working properly
"I am not getting option of send the meeting to a channel. It needs to be repaired pls. On mobile and pc both, instead of Callender option a Meetings option comes and only setup of name time and date is available nothing else."
Worst experience
"Im giving 2 stars because it has a lot of problems: 1:It always crashes and restarts. 2:It always lags. 3:Some people don't have raise your hand option. 3:A lot of bugs. 4:Trouble updating. 5:It takes a long time to login on pc. 6:Some people can't access the assignments. 7:even when I set my status to don't disturb,I still get notifications,not urgent,normal messages.Microsoft please fix these problems â˜¹ï¸"
I am totally satisfied with the app but it camera quality is so low so plz fix that
"I can never get connected. Whenever I have a meeting using Teams, I have to be invited. I have to call help desk for instructions; while being assisted, meeting is almost over. VERY FRUSTRATING."
It's a gud app but there is no chat and raise hand option I'm very disappointed. I request to fix it
The screen was losing its clarity frequently and created a lot of disturbances.
"Consumes high amount of data with bad quality of video, lags in screen sharing also whiteboard starts very slowly. Zoom is better platform learn something from them"
Its consumes huge data and battery aslo
Microsoft plz add a option in meeting to mute the teacher or organiser for only me so that we can bunk closses peacefully and thank you in advance ðŸ¥°
It is a nice app but sometimes it hangs.
UM THUS APP HAS CHANGED I BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND IT DOESN'T WANT ME TO ENTER THE TEAMS.PLS FIX THIS I HEG U

We can not see our result more than 1 time
"When we receive notifications, even though we didn't go inside and see the messages, it's automatically marked as read in some cases. And if someone is calling on teams and if I'm away from teams, it's showing as online for others but I'm away from teams and also away from my phone. This both issues are very bad experience."

This app is not good because some time I am unable to join .This day my class is left and when I try to join as an attende they show me organiser and my class is disconnected after 5 sec.
Should include more features

Trash i everything is fine but it didnt allow me to change my pfp to a bull shiter picture to mess around on calls
I always need to sing in on or reinstall this app to get it works. Really frustrating
As I use my bluetooth earphone... It suddenly starts hanging... Needs to be improved
This is very good app
Stop trying to force me to review the app.
Worst app ever !!!!
It's very boringðŸ˜‘
"I have to use this for work and it's alright, but the connection cuts when other apps like this don't, and there isn't enough tech support within the app to do any troubleshooting yourself, or any contact info as the links on the mobile app give you instructions for the PC app and they don't always line up with what it says to do."
"Sending voice is not working. Showing ""error occurred"" when i click the microphone button"

This app in mobile doesn't have chatbox for chatting in a meeting....thats just irritating
Super
I ended up in the wrong room & missed the CCG presentation! Since leaving that meeting it is a permanent notification and counting the hours. Currently 165 hours. It gives me the option of rejoining call or hang up or unmute. The hang up option won't hang up!!! I'll uninstall the app & see if that gets rid of it?

Everything is fine but the worst part is that we can't see who removes us from the ongoing chat which is really frustating.This is not expected from a big company like Microsoft.

Your app is not so good but we can make meeting easily and can present record but it is hard to present but your app is best . Your app is not good app and your app is hanging too much. So I rated 2 stars .ðŸ˜šðŸ˜™

"Teams drains out data. I have 4 GB Per Day. I use teams from 8 till 1. After using, The data balance will be somewhere between 1 GB To 2GB. Then what about the 2 GB drains.

"Took awhile to figure somethings out, still don't know how everything works. Put links for instructions on how to use MIC-Teams.Thank you."
"OK on the whole. However, it still needs the ability to reply to a single message in a conversation within a channel. This is a basic chat app function. Sometimes our team's conversation gets quite active. One wants to reply to a particular post, but by the time one does so, that post has been buried in the conversation by subsequent posts. Make replies possible and put it at the top of the ""3-dot"" menu options."
All the due assignments can be shown at place
Great for keeping in touch with colleagues..
The camera is not working.
When it opens the teams loads for like 5mins for it to work
It's good not best because in this app some options working and some are not working.

I am facing some issue with my mic that is why I have given 3 stars
Assignment section is not opening
"Teams is becoming horrible day by day. If I want to text something during my class and I press the back button, it takes me right to the home screen and again I have to open the channel clock on the meeting chat to reply. And this takes me ages to do so. I never answer my sisr question on time(since we're are not allowed to unmute ourselves). This is damn frustrating. Resolve this issue. IMMEDIATELY. I'VE HAD JUST ENOUGH OF NONSENSE. And btw, the new update is sickening . UGHHHH."
"This is good app, developed by Microsoft but looks like all updates are available only for iOS & Win OS not for Android. Why Microsoft can not make same Teams options (blurred background) on Android also like other OS."
Doesn't refresh well on my device
ok ok
"Really am impressed and its easy to use interface but sometime during calls I face problems like keep getting automatically disconnected in between even if not facing any network problems, there is like some distortion that we keep getting when hearing someone, There has been a problem of sometimes not been able to hear other person's voice or our voice not been heard by other person during calls. Please consider checking it. And add features to reach bottom of chat its frustrating to scroll it"

Poor performance on mobile networks
"This app is good but when I ask a question from email , and now 1 month is complete but it not send me the answer. Such a bad system ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’"
This is a good app
Hmm good app but sometimes trouble with network but still it's the best online classs app
Good app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘â˜ºï¸ðŸ™‚
It's very good but calendar option do not come
I have give it only 3 stars because it has no background during the meeting and it is very slow network but my network is full.
This app is good but is a bit buggy
But it has a problem in it
Good quality
It is a good app but I felt a discomfort that if somebody mute me I am not able to view that person. Kindly improve that problem. I also felt that this app is very slow in laptop
It's good
Good
It's gud
This app is very useful for group video calls
It is very good app as it helps us to attend class and helps us to chat with each other
Focusing problem other than that it's a useful and helpful app
I can't join the video call after the latest update
Ok
This is a really good app..my online school is going very smoothly....but this app sometimes hangs..pls do something about that
So nice app but some Techinical ptoblem is there if I open it all time it tell how you rate this app this is a big techinal problem plese work on that
It is good but needs more development as the app is not quick
Usefull
I can't upload my files that is very important for me to send..
How to change back ground of my online class
Its not much user friendly but is considerable.
This app is really good people are able to attend classes and meetings as well !! But the only problem is sometimes it just starts to function on its own!!....And yes it aslo uses a lot of data !!!!
Starting freezing upon launch this week.
Uncle to share video sound during presentation for Mac users.
"This is a good app, just like to say that sometimes I can't see when the class already started. I don't know why but it would take time before I can see or notice it."
There is a glitch while using this app
I had a query if I attend a ms teams meeting with two devices would it recognise the 2nd device as a no name in the attendance list though I access it with my own account?
"Good, for keeping in touch, and school stuff; but if the internet slow downs just a bit, it doesn't let you send school work, photos take forever to load, and messages take forever to be received, and the phone version, doesn't have all the benefits of the computer version"
Good
"A good app, but it is so disappointing that there is no ""meet now"" option as it does when using a PC or MS Windows desktop."
"Okay app. Requires a lot of memory to run and causes other apps to glitch when it's running (text message mostly), which then requires a reboot to solve. Typical Microsoft issues and bugs."
"Good one amongst the MS tools. Yet, need to work on bugs. Bugs like, app don't open from notification, call ringing continues even if you pick it up on another device."
"This app is incredibly helpful when using in computers but the app on the phone has some bugs. In a teams call, if the content is being shared, the screen seems to be slanted on the phone. Absolutely no proper visibility of the screen being shared on phone. It would be great if it's looked into and fixed! Regards, Pratibha"
I don't know what went wrong. Teams option has not appeared in the bar
Bluetooth headset option is not available on phone application
"Actually this is a good app. But it has some problems also. In this app sometimes we are not be able to join some of the important meetings. So, please improve the app."
Its glitchy sometimes... but a grant way to stay connected .
"Good app, the only thing is that when I go to the chat it doesn't take me to the recents messages, it's all the way up"
App works great. Needs more features to stand out from other Apps that do the same thing.
Nice
Used the app on my android. Good sound and video quality
Thikkkkk hai
I love how i can teach chidren easier
It's good but if u clear the screen picture so it will be good
"It asumes a lot of data and videos are not clear we cant see everyone we should pin them it is really difficult to see the presentation sent by the teachersshould improve. if a bit of low connection we get the app gets closed and always 1 msg comes like "" teams is not reaponding"" please check to it.i have 1 more big problem if am loging out my brothers id and using my id and continueing the test given by teachers it is showing my brothers id and telling that if u submit ur name will be shown.."
Improve voice clearity and loudness.When i screen share and play video application not support better voice and picture.Teams app not played diksha app portal video.
The interface is so bad...and....I recorded a meeting which by the gets recorded by the organiser's name....and now it's suddenly disappeared??? It was an important school lecture...ðŸ˜ðŸ˜¶
it is a best app
Sometimes its hanging and consuming more memory
"Please still make your application more and more easy to access so that the students can easily work on it and make login system so easy,,,,, and it can operated through mobile simcard so everyone can use it,,,,, not make so complicated,,,,,,, make easy,,,, make easy,,,, make easy like WhatsApp messenger,,,,,,"
"App is good , but needs to improve notifications time delay"
I have been having a lot of problems with this recently when I click on the link to join the meeting the screen just was super black I hope my problem is taken into consideration and I hate the lobby feature it's soooo boring to wait in their for hours
It has started consuming a lot data... Like 1gb for 3 hrs only on mobile. First it used to be 1gb for 5-6 hours... Please fix this.
"So so slooow to load onto the phone. It's easy enough to use if someone invotes you to a meeting. Just click on the link and go. But oh dear if you want to set up an account so that you can set up your own meeting ? Forget it. Fed up with watching the circle tell me it's just loading or I'm nearly there. Apparently ""I'm all done. Hang on while we get things ready for you."" Yawn."
Screen sharing of video shows error after a while n sound goes missing
It's not a good app and just sometimes doesn't even work would not recommend
It uses lot of data approx 400 mb for 1 hour... Kindly reduce the data usage
Require high bandwidth internet compare to zoom .
What's happening with the app? I can't even turn in my assignment.
Sound volume is a bit low even if i put it at max
Sometimes it becomes very slow. Overall its good
add virtual background on android 6 or up...
I want to give a suggestion that Teams should have private meeting recording option and it should have background effects in mobile version
I'm receiving notifications for messages that I've seen and replied on the computer. Needs too much time to update the chat history when I open the app
How to delete the file of Microsoft teams from Android phone?
#4200 Gujarat

Good but it sometimes it itself only logout of the account .
I joined one meet. The screen was shared and was blank white. This bug is been for such a long time. Please look into it. I have given 3 stars just for its safety and features. Thanks
Very heavy
Good app but always have problems.
"Pretty decent set of features from Team. However can't edit Excel Sheets, and can't filter view for only me"
"I want to change background,for always but this option is only available for teachears,why is this so? Please tell me what should I do??there no option coming still now that change background effects only .only one day that option is coming and the other day it is not coming ,why is this so? I want that option wright now my meeting is going on please give me that option forever"
It is good app but this app is asking only password for enter class
Ankush Khorate good app but not clear
In whatsapp there is an options called admin.only admins can do most of the stuff but in Microsoft teams there is no admins option. So i request to add admin option and it will be nice if we can change chats profile.
Very good app
Useful
It is very good I would make it 5 stars but there are features to be added for example add a chat button in the mute and unsure bar in the meeting. Please make the calendar like the windows version. And please make it as close as possible like the windows version because it is better it is good but add the chat button and my rating will be 5stars.
Doesn't work good when 300 students join at a time.
I am not able to send any messages to any one
O.k.GoodClass
Sometimes this don't function well.
"The only reason to give it 3 star is , In app there are too many bugs...in a meeting of 1 hour we waste our 10 minutes fixing bugs...:("
I'mma give it 5 if the internet here in Ph gets fast lol
This app is good but sometimes when l have joined in the meeting and after 3 seconds its seeing that you are in the lobby and after that l am trying to join but the link is not opening
Good app for schools
The thing is sometimes it shows that we couldn't complete the call and the do can't be reset
"My mic is not working. The other side cannot hear my voice, please tell me how to fix this. It only works when I reinstall this app and then to it will work only for a limited amount of time, I have to keep reinstalling it."
It's good
I have logged teams into a account and I have a work and I am trying to download files but it is coming no file sharing and downloads are allowed but I called my boss and he told for all it is coming accept me so I tried in my friend phone and it came and that friend phone is vivo v11 pro and my phone is galaxy m10 .please solve this issue as soon as possible.
It is really very difficult to upload pdf
Very good Aap but many times it log out with itself
"It is good but there should be some improvement in the app. Sometimes we can hear a sonic sound, there is a problem in joining a meeting, others can't hear what I am saying. Other than these the app is great."
Okok
"Teams app is the best app for school ,offices to do anything"
Nice
Good app but its very difficult to login it is not is easy as in google.
We can't edit our profile picture while being a guest
Nice app cured my depression
"Not too bad if you only have one account. But I have 2 accounts and it keeps logging me out of one of them, so I don't get any notifications, I an unable to reply from one of the accounts, and so on."
Not easy
Nice
It would hang after every 2 to 3 days Pls solve this problem in teams ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
It's going to good
Why I give 3star because there is 2 problem 1)the voices are cuting and coming 2)the video is not clear But this app is very nice this is good for learning thank you
it doesr work half of the time
Not nice
EVERYTHING IS OK BUT VIDEO CLARITY IS BAD
Good app to learn but takes more battery me
Good
Chat option is missing please give an update for this app.
Good
"I use this app exclusively for uploading my school work. However, it seems to have an issue. Whenever it finishes uploading something for an assignment and I try clicking on it, nothing happens. I exit the assignment and it's gone. Only when the image is accessable on the app after loading does it work. If this can be fixed as soon as possible, it would be appreciated."
It is a great app
It lags A LOT
"Good features, but too memory and battery intensive compared to similar apps."
Poor video quality in team meeting specially when screen is shared. No internal feature to assign works to members and observe the progress.
Better than Skype
The app is good
Needs improving on connections. It sometimes take longer than it should be.
",n"
The app times out too quickly.
"App mt pesado, mau otimizado e pouco funcional."
Nice
I face video buffer
Need a month calender view on teams
I hate when you have to download different apps for some features.
"Para ser honestos creo que en global es una buena app, perfecta para la escuela, pero dios, es tan horrible hacer las clases aquÃ­, en verdad, son de pÃ©sima calidad"
Glitches and keep kicking out
Can be way better for primary school students
ITS VERY LAGGY
To hard to use but good for school would suggest using it for school and studies and your jobðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼
Needs more net to run smoothly otherwise working good
Sometimes messages won't allow you to hit the send button and you need to reopen the app. Other than that it's perfect.
freezez grafics not that good
Basically ok with a little difficulty navigating.
Good to use it but sometimes not all features works
Whenever I send a message from the notification it gives me. It doesnt send.
Good App for professional meatings but Sometimes audio is muting and presentation video is stucking.
It is good for easy communication
"It's a great app ,but the faccillators can read the chat"
Call keeps falling.
This app is so frustrating. It keeps stopping again and again. I have sent around 3 reports till now regarding the same issue but there is no response. I just don't know how I am going to attend my classes.
Mmmm meh
My teams is not working properly. When you are in the meeting you can't use the chat option present in the meeting and you can't come out of the meeting. You can only come out when the meeting is ended. It also needs full Internet if internet is little low the meeting will disconnect
Good features but consumes lot of RAM and internet bandwidth
Its ok
It's good app for online classs
Idiotic but good app
Best
Zoom meeting I think good
unlike Zoom it is not Trainer centric; when i share & present i am unable to hv on my screen to see all my trainees' faces for cues on their understanding tge material. Zoom can do this.
Its not good average Microsoft is my favorite but this is not good want many bug fixes and it easily out of when not having internet at 1sec
Good
"This App is good But sometimes in online class Some students remove other students from class for no reason So, in the upcoming update just fix this issue by adding the feature which can show the name of person who is removing students from class for no reason or just for fun This is the only drawback of the app. Consider this as early as possible."
Too slow to open link
Large application and can cause lagging. Prefer the mobile app as it allows me to change between accounts with ease!
"Great app, just improve the lag In some of the calls"
Actually this app is great but has some issues but generally it is really good i have and had a fun experience with it
In screen share no audio come in video playing pease add for smartphones
Nice app
Chat option is not there
Not that stable on calls and causes the app to lag of doing other activities while on a call.
it worked fine but now I can't connect to my meetings my WiFi works fine in other apps like YouTube Instagram and etc
Sometime have network issues and no clear voice
It's a good app if I compare with other and I really like it for my studies but some times it show network issues and voice start breaking and that's why I give 3 stars only to this app
Nice app
Nice
Ok . Not very good
Plz set meeting limit
Required high Battry power.Need high speed of internet.
Whenever I joined the last period the teams app get automatically removed from metting not some who is removing me when I get started the metting I come In my mobile home screen so pls Microsoft teams do this promble hel ðŸ™ I can not joined the last period and my friends of school also cannot attend the last period
Nice
Please add video background for mobile users also
This app lags a little on desktop... Zoom is the best anyhow
"I need an update iny laptop's Ms teams because whenever I attend a meeting, I cannot put the view in gallery view and it also does not show all of my teams"
It keeps kicking me out and say looking for network but the network is in front of me literally
Nicee
very nice
Super
Good to speak with friends but still some problems are there to be cleared
This application is excellent but some time their is very slow connection and sometimes I can't able to get joining option
"Facing problems regularly. Firstly, there're multiple times when I try joining a meeting but it shows 'not started' whereas it opens up on my laptop. Secondly, the file section dosen't show files properly. It flashes the files and then they're not seen."
Its present the screen late.....???
Chanikya 19
Sometimes it may not working fast but good to use than other apps... ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Its a good app for taking our online classes.....great app
It's my first experience. But looks good
This app had going good but from 2 days it is not working properly 1:- where I'm touching I can't get to know before it was there after update it is not coming that touch feature is really good as I get to know where I'm touching. 2:- And while screen sharing it has slow down my tablet.
Nice app
My video is not seeing by other
It is not as friendly user as other apps with similar features.
Not that much of good experience cause Anyone can make attendee to everyone unless and until organizer has made attendee please fix this issue this is irritating during online classes.
I cant log in it by entering password it shows wrong password after uninstalling again it is not showing enter password option how can i refresh it as i am using first time i have to attend for online clasess
Come on! It crashes and doesn't respond!
"9/28 it was lagging on my phone so i thought i had to re install the app. First i restared my phone, it still didnt open one of my teams then i uninstalled it and reinstalled... I thought it couldn't get any worse but it did. Network? Idk what this is supposed to mean but ""smth wrong w/ network"" when i tried signing in to Teams."
Theres alot of bugs
"The app is really good, but also truly slow... It might be faster."
Is not that good. Much better is Meet by Google.
"Not the best, could be better on the signing back in after having to sign out!!"
Disappointingly buggy
Tutorial on how to use this for parents thanks
Its for school work so not that good
want all features of Windows Apps in Android ang Linux
Still in the learning process
i installed this app for my online shcool it firsted good until like the 10th day it started to be bad the teacher can't let me in the class plus my marks getting lower Why? beacuse it says if you are late/not in class it will take marks which is not a good thing. thank you and i hope you have a good day/night
ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Cannot receive notifications in China
It still needs improvement in terms of visual cues for people with disabilities.
But that time speed is reduce. Sometimes take long time to open the app
"No user friendly in 2GB RAM, heavy interface"
Good
I do my classes on it and it is the best app but one thing i want in this app is that is should have a background changing option in mobiles and tablets too this is why i am giving it three stars.
i think its good but there is a few immprovements to make such as that i sometimes cant get in to a powerpoint
Microsoft teams when i am signing that time it is coming that you can't do with one no. Two sign two times plz resolve it i can use this no. Only plz hope i get a reply
Taking awhile to respond
It ss good but nor much
It was Nice!
This app is good I liked to use this app but the only reason I give it 3 stars is it hangs my phone ðŸ“± otherwise it gets full stars................ but I like this app
Just good for school work
"Hey dev team, I am not able to login into the app (android). I am getting ""Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in. Please try again."" error everytime I try to login. When do I expect the new version of the app with this bug fixed? Device: Samsung Galaxy M51"
It's good for teachers but not good for students U'll get **** up if u try to act smart . Teachers have n no of options whereas students don't.
i had good experience
"Does the job but wish it had bigger screen support like outlook does. It will have so much potential when it will support big screen; ie. galaxy notes, fold, and many tablets can benefit from it!!"
"Whenever someone shares his screen during call, we see distorted screen sharing and it doesn't get fixed."
laggy
After the teams was updated to the newest version it keeps on crashing and sometimes i cant even join a conference call
"It eats my phone up when installed. I just install Teams when I absolutely need it, then remove when the event is done."
Good experience
"I would like a feature that would show all assigned assignmemts that aren't turned in yet, or like a feature that shows all the assignments for the week. That's all!!"
As it consumes too much memory. Requires high network
It would be nice if there would a screenshot option on the screen
should add virtual background for mobiles otherwise ok
"May be I don't know either best app or not, since I install every time it has been open unknowingly and distorted everything repeatedly. Some times fed up and uninstalled. When ever need am doing installation again. If there is any bug fix team, please make through it and fix it permanently, Thank you"
Well it definetly needs some fixes.it slows down your computer and can be kinda laggy.
Good
I didn't use it yet...... In fact I'm not confortable with this one
It was working good but from few days I'm not able to use it there is issue with Sign in and I'm not able to join
Please...!!!!! Please remove the option of admitting participants... May classes move slowly after this feature has been installed... It's very much disturbing... Please remove the option.
It's best app but In my mobile there is no callender in team that's why I gave 3 stars
I've only used it for chat so cannot comment on file usage etc. Is very convenient and keeps up to date well. Seems straight forward to use. I would like the option to delete conversations for GDPR purposes.
Add screen view option for mobile version
It nice but every meeting is always 2 hrs early than the mentioned time
Video calling can be improved and there is lot of disturbance of voice
Good Services very easy to oprate this app
Slides won't load when the teacher is only Sharing the ppt. And it should notify us when a meeting start in the pre joined teams. Make everyone presenter when the presenter is not present.
Still a bit difficult to use
Iam not able to remove profile picture. How do I do that?
It's a nice app for my baby's online classes.
"Very bad . When I installed an update , it showed that you are not added to any team , while I am added to 6 teams ."
It's a good app but when I'm in one of my classes it gets lagggy and glitchy and then makes me leave the app
New update is sucks..i unable to change my name.This app automatically take my mail id as my name.Please fix this
This app was extremely created for educational purposes. But everything was awesome but when share a screen it was not showing anything it's like only blank with full screen of black colour. It was really disgusting ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜“. Instead of this all was awesome.
It have to improve video and sound lagging
It stops once in evey week ... Stops responding and hangs itself which makes it unbearable for me because it's irritating !!
When I open chat box it shows me the chats since the team has been formed and have to scroll down to view the latest chats.
Due to ths app online classes are still better to attend consumes less data n almost good
Good
This app it so nice but did it 3
Okay
Good app
"Almost everything is fine but some complain are : There is no option to see who remove you from the class, I think you should give to see it. Also, whiteboard is not rotatable."
"Good app till last update but In pc , now I am not able to maximize the screen of meeting owner , hence I can't see the whole board."
Hey i am not having the option of background change
Ok but not great I would like some more updates and that's it for my rating 3 star And it takes all my space it is 468 mb like what if I delete this a will have a lot of space Allot allot allot like 56 GB I am telling you
"I try to log in same id persow accout its not working while i login organizations profile its working,"
"This app was initially work fine. Now after logging in, it keeps shifting from login screen to home screen rapidly. The entire app has to be force closed and restarted for it to function. Can someone please rectify and enable smoother login process??"
Good
Good keep it up!!
ï¼«ï¼¤ ï¼§ï¼¯ï¼·ï¼¤ï¼²ï¼µ
This is an upcoming collaboration software that actually works the voice and video features as well. the presentation features are fantastic and it's get improved over time The challenge for the Android version would be for those that are on the ro who are happening to take the call on the road The control button are hidden and required a tap to bring it up and each other button are so small that is almost impossible to click on the button. Zoom does this better.
It's a very good app for schools but sometimes it glitches
good 4 every thing
Its is excllent but some time chat box does not give notifcation
Good
Not good not bad
Every thing is good in it but it laggs alort
The experience is not much too good this app need more updates ðŸ‘
Very hard to sign in when I put the correct password it's telling it's wrong
App hangs and im unable to join meeting someimes.Does it support change background?
Good
Good
Good

So so
Chat box is freezed after going in chat box. After going back and again going in chat box then lony it shows the chats in chat box. Very inappropriate.
This app is good and best app for lectures of school and collages
There some errors like mic problem ... sometimes it wont work!....please see that and fix that issue...it causes a lot of problem while attending the class session..add data saver mode....please so that it easy for mobile students and lapi students too.. thankqu! For just an amazing app!
It's good but some changes to do
"Exceptional, but there are features that mobile phones require."
I cant share audio.the rest of it is excellent
Sir can you please tell how to hide the names in android when other is Sharing screen like HS or rs at bottom
Good app consumes less data
"it is actually big help to have this app running even for android users, but it would also be a big help for us if you allow us to also access some features on PC app like change background and download attendance fo example."
Nice
It is good but when teachers do screeen sharing then some students cant able to see the screen
Waste app google duo is muh better as compared no video clarity over phones and also there is a software issue or might be the server which never let me in as then I join it just loads and loads till the whole class is done to overcome this issue we should rejoin and try to do uninstalling and reinstalling. So far I have faced almost all problem like touble with server video audio etc even my internet gets on high speed. Certainly I say that this app requires development. It is good few times
Please download
"I use this app for my school online classess,i have to use this other wise i am not a lil bit also happy with this app . Sometimes its soo irritating when it shows that there is no classess for thus week i call my friends and tge say that the classess r there. .....its vry frustrating"
Only glitches like call drop are a problem
before update I could see 8 people on screen. how to get that back.
Okh okh
It is good but it contains some glitches
It is good app but when i try to join from my mobile i can't join only but from my laptop i can join but in emergency i can't join only
Not so good
"A major annoying oversight is the lack of meet now feature on the android version. Also with the latest update meeting chats aren't updating. As a result I can't see the messages I send, nor can I see the messages others send."
"I am using this app for schooling. The major problem is that if a meeting is set at 9am, I can see that link in calendar as ""meeting at 9am"". If I click on the same meeting link at 8 am (1hr before), instead of 9am, even then the meeting can be started. It should throw an error or something and not allow users to start that meeting before the scheduled time. Also, whenever I check the files uploaded on diff channels, I've to sort it by ""newer to older"" EVERYTIME"". It's damn irritating."
"SO MANY OVER DUES, IT FREAKS ME OUT INSTEAD OF MAKING THE OVER DUES RED CAN IT BE PURPLE OR SOMTHING TYVM."
Ok
I gave 3 starts because the app is irritating it is nice but sometimes when I join the audio kept freezing and video also. So I want to say that me and my friends are struggling very connectivity problems so please see to that. Please please please. Requesting
The concept is great but I get those darn notifications all day and night and yes you can turn them off but thats completely not specific members id like to be able to silence team members but not my coach outside of that it serves its purpose
Audio and video lag too much when I use my android tablet. Camera autofocus is a problem when I take online meeting or class using my camera.
It's superb but still a little slow compared to other meetings app
Poorly designed.
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
bad
Great apps
Good
Good app
VOICE ALWAYS BREAK
It seems nice and creating a comfortable platform
"Teams is awesome on pc,but in phone there are little bugs,that is really irritating.Some problems are listed below: Problem 1: I can see all my teams group that I have been added in PC version of teams.But in an immediate situation only one or two teams can be seen in Android version. Problem 2: sometimes I am unable to join meetings.Sometimes join button disappears. Problem3:Once I didn't got calls when my sir called me.But after sometime I can see missed call from sir.teams is not responding"

The app is good but you can improve its video quality and audio quality. video quality and audio quality are good but you can improve it so it will be more good. You know when ever I join a meeting through teams the Voice comes but it echo a lot. Please fix this bug.
Not to much good
"This app is great, however with the latest update some features aren't working or sometimes take too long to upload like the chat. Also, the microphone suddenly opens out of nowhere when the meeting is lagging. But overall, I still thank the hard work and wish for a new update to fix things."

Consume so much data.
"Very good app, very well organised but in between some netwoek problem happens"
Nice application
Pretty good
delete all chat option is not avilable...please improve this..
It's feels organized and smooth
Can be used
"It works well on laptop for me. However, when I use it on my phone it gives me a problem to use it through speaker option. I cannot talk through my speaker while attending a call."
Nice
Its good but internet isvrequired too much
phone is switched off suddenly while the class is going on
"Es una app demasiado sencilla y eficaz a la vez. Lo unico que deberia agregar de funcionalidad es el poder eliminar archivos, de ahi en fuera, muy buena app."
"Great app. Assignments (or quizzes) need some modifications, e.g. add a range for correct numeric answers not just definite answers. Also, it is better to allow importing questions from other quizzes. Thanks a lot"
Its ok
Overall good app to use and also works best in phones.
This app is good but this is what i'm using for online class. Tf! I hate school
Microsoft is best app meting and online study
Hangsup call due to low signal
"This app is good but you should allow us to change background in any mobile, laptop and tab... Not only newly launched ios devices"
It's good
"Very great app... â¤ï¸it. M using a tablet (android device). There whenever u hv to go d assignments section, it shows 'no data found' ðŸ˜±. It never shows class materials folder. Sometimes i cannot even enter the class, then i hv to uninstall the app and install again.ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ Anytime people hang from the meeting even if the network is quite strong. If someone shares a video, only sound is audible no video. And that only happens with android users. Not windows, Mac or iPhone users. Pls update the app."
"It is a great app for teachers to use. It helps a lot to conduct lectures/online-exams. But I found two major shortcomings in this app. 1. I cannot download attendance sheet of students present through (the mobile version of) the app. 2. While setting up Quizzes, I can't use matrices in the option buttons. In fact it would have been powered with full-fledged Math Equation Editor as in MS WORD. I wil re-think of giving 5 ðŸŒŸ once these issues get sorted out. Thank you."
"Turnoff mechanism is problematic, usually I will keep getting work messages even after closing the app."
It's so good
Nice. But poor audio quality.. could do better
Goosd
Nice app
"App itself is kinda laggy. When I open a Word, PowerPoint or any file in the app, everything gets distorted and not where it should be or not the way it should look like. When I use the chat or present, it lags even though my internet is fine. What's worse is that the mobile version is completely different and hard to use than the desktop version. I'm using this app for my online high school education. It's good overall, it just needs some fixes that need attention fast."
The answer selected and the one submitted keeps changing . Work on MS Forms integration with MS Teams
Amazing
So laggy
The software should be updated so that uploading documents take less time
Need some improvement and finishing.
Nice
Good app but has many login problems in it.
Not bad app But something should be fixed
Unable to open the downloaded file.
"Complete solution for holding online classes. However, the app crashes a lot."
Team app.....very helpful for online classes But..... Slow connection ......
I'm giving this app a 3 star because the only problem I face in a meeting is mic error and failed to send message even at such good internet connection
It's good but need some modifications âœŒï¸âœŒï¸ðŸ˜‘
Nice app. The caption s don't work properly..the captions keep going down and we have to hold the screen to see the words below..it doesn't show properly...pls fix that
"Even I am using Chrome browser, and update the app, and clear cache too, still there is no hand raising option. Do resolve"
Nice but sometimes it becomes leggy
Very very useful for education purpose. But I hear some Eco while the class. Please fix it. Then suddenly the presentation stops. Please fix it. Thank you
It is a very good app but in laptop sometimes it shows that there is a glitch we are trying to recover so pls solve this problem.
It needs so much internet
"Actually I do my school online classes in teams app .. Whenever I try to open any assignment it always show ' Sorry , we can't take u to this destination now . ' And I am not able to open my assignment in feed section .. I have to take go to assignments and then I have to choose my class and then I have to choose the assignment and then it opens .. It takes a lot time ... So , please please help me .. And yes I have also updated my teams app many times but it doesn't work .."
Really good but sometimes picture quality went wrong
Not bad
"Some time I can't join the meeting,it shows""we ran into a problem you can't join""but it is good"
When more people are join in meeting app work very slow
Better
this app is good but take so much time to work
Nice app
It doesn't let me change my account picture and it's soooo laggy
"Great for team work, though have often had issues where messages just don't send so have to switch to a computer to respond which voids the point in the app"
Bad
"This app is cool,i like how its working"
I am not able to record meetings
this app is ok but when i am in class it sometimes gliches me out of my class and dose not let me back on . This app could be better .
Satisfactory not very good app
"It is fair, but I have some issues that are really irritating. First of all, when you go into chat it goes all the way to first group of comments and you have to scroll all the down just to see the recent comments,there is a button that appears to carry you to the recent comments but it works EXTREMELY slow. Secondly of all, it sometimes takes a lengthy time period to load the chat. I have another problem, when someone is presenting something the person's icon blocks part of the screen."
ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
Add reply directly to someone in desktop version
Bit confusing at first but once you have. Alook around the app it's easy and good to use
Its not bad i really like this but it can get better
Using this app for about a year now. To often I had to reinstall it in case of some issues occur which is disturbing
It is a good and also a worst app bcoz there is no option to delete messages so plzz add delete message option.
Using for online classes and done a great job Try to improve and optimise the. App And add an option direct access to camera
Is ok
"Meh. Does some things well. Does others poorly. Very poor error messages (e.g. ""Can't access now. Try later."" When everything else in the app is working."
I am not able to find the recorded meetings ðŸ˜ž in chat as well as in Microsoft Stream after the update.
It was nice ðŸ˜Š
Where are the private messages?
Nice
Sticking alot
Ok
Good app but i have clases on him so 3 star sorry microsoft
How I remove my dp in ms team???
Not pad
Sometimes chat option is not visible
Isme kisi bacha ko maza nhi aata kyuki isme parhai hota hae...... While using this application in attending class screen turn off and on when the call sensor is touched mostly in realme 5pro.
Good app
Three star rating because it doesn't display the presentations during meetings... Otherwise works well.
Hat
I am giving only 3 stars to it bcoz it doesn't tells us about who made us the addentee and who removed us from meetings and also we can't delete the chats which is sended by someone. And also it takes a lot of data as well as internet.
"It's quite glitchy, but does the job. I wish I wasn't getting so many notifications though. One missed call and everything gets lit up (activity, calls)"
Teams app its getting into my nervesðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡..plz fix the bug as soon as possible...on frequent basis it removes me from the meeting automatically...till 6mos its performance was ok but later on it seems with increasing users many problems have arised...i am giving u 3 star as ur performance was good intially...pls dont neglect this review and try to fix the bugðŸ˜¡
Good
we want our rightfor 4200 grade from gujarat government and we want it.#4200 gujarat
Nice but if all mikes are unmuted Disturbance was happening
camera quality could be better and screen sharing quality as well
"While video quality was good, the audio volume was very low over the phone speaker."
Teams is best online class and in these class we ask question easyly
I installed application and signed for free but after two days it is not working properly so I deleted the app without signout so now my no. Is registered and when I am entering my mobile number it is saying that already signed in so what I want to do
Nice ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜Šapp
We should be informed when the meeting starts and there is no notification when a new file is uploaded
It does not seem to show the join option most of the time i want to join the meeting
"They have one problem if some body will message you , it is not giving buzz as Skype does"
It has a bug in joining a class
The call has poor qualities so i give it only 3 stars
It is easy and nice to use teams app
Nice app but sometimes hangs for a long time......
"Bluetooth support is not stable, sometimes it needs a device restart to get it working. As somebody have mentioned, this problem is specific to this app."
Recently I am facing trouble with teams ..it's not working on my mobile phone where as it's working on laptop..is there any remedy
Nice but needs more improvement
nice but little disturbing
someone removes me from meeting and it not says who removes me . so please make some changes . so that i can know who removes me. please reply . that is only problem i face. that is why i give 3 stars.
"Actually it was a nice app but after the updation it's not working well ,the students cannot watch the recorded class on their phone.pls give the option for watching recorded class......"
"Cant connect to calls on this app using my android phone while the app works good on the desktop.Whenever i try to pick up a call on my mobile phone,it disconnects it."
Best
"The will get heat automatically and sometimes it will shutdown automatically, one day heat increased alot please then shutdown your mobile in that condition, I hope Microsoft will solve this problem soon"
Some times the audio doesn't gets connected with the Bluetooth headset and its really annoying. Please solve this problem
"I prefer everyone to use this app for official and unofficial use, but i think the features which are there on desktop the same features should be there on mobile too as once when i my laptop was discharged i decided to take my meating through my mobile but the option of keeping the background was not there and the meating was not recorded and i got disappointed,i thought that i should give you 5 stars but when i just thought about And another thing i think it should be more user friendly ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ"
Nice app for Education.
Ky samjena ks vaparayach....
Teams is good app app . But I am facing many problems that I can't blur my background and earlier I can see recording but now it is not visible in mobile and in computer I have to download it then watch and many times it ask me to sign in again and again and many times notifications are also not visible some time teacher is not able to present and make us attendes . So I request u to please improve.
Why you are not showing that who is removing us from the meeting in next update please let the attendees be know who is removing
Nice app the only problem is there is huge delay in video sharing
App is good but something which is needed is not given .one is we can't remove our profile and many times it detect slow internet. don't showing meeting in proper time. please fix all this problem
This app is very good
I'll give 3 stars because the voice breaks too much so I couldn't understand what my mam is saying... Then the other prblm is hen I am not using teams the also automatically it opens that irritates me too much.. whenever I am using other aap then also these problem happens.. I would request you that if there is some technical issue then plz recover it ðŸ˜Šotherwise the aap is good bcoz it is helping me a lot to do my regular classes..
Their is problem in sign in by school side please solve this problem
ðŸ‘Œ
Good for online class ðŸ˜Š
Does not work properly on laptop and you are most probably prefer to choose a laptop for online classes or meetings
Good but something's are not right in this app
its fair
"Es buena, pero aveces la app se queda inhibida"
It's hanging or making the device so slow while in call.
"The combined desktop and mobile apps work well for remote business collaboration. The desktop chat needs a ""quoted"" reply function to allow replies to specific messages inna chat (like what is available in teams mobile and whatsapp and messenger and.....)"
"The app is awesome with its features and well designed but i've got stuck because im not able to schedule a call with my co workers, would u plz help me out !"
i wish this app would be more optimize ..im having a hard time opening and dowloading some files
"I use the MS Teams App as part of my childrens online learning experience.I gave this APP a rating of 3,because I don't feel that it has the same ""User Friendliness/ functionality"" as the MS Teams website itself.In order to get to the areas we need to utilize,we need to dig/search longer than we should have to. Also, chat/messaging functionality isn't on the homescreen like it should be. If there's an app that is conneceted to a company/website, I feel that it should provide the same options."
Good features but really slow on my device
"It's rlly good, but in a meeting it's pretty laggy"
I like it but its a little complercaited
It is kinda good on the phone but glitchy and some of the controls aren't there. But it works for the most part and I'm glad that it does. ðŸ˜
The interface is a bit confusing . The interface needs to be simplified a lot....room for improvement. The digital whiteboard's there but it's not much use . The app crashes randomly and very frequently. The call quality is just horrible sometimes.
Why do we need to on internet to open file that is already downloaded in our device ? Please do something about this issue. Overall Apps is Good and quiet safe to use.
It's good but from yesterday it's not opening any files
Nice chating app we can use it officially
Sometimes it closes
Convenient. Have been using it since I started working from home. Has a problem with randomly closing though.
Still trying to learn its capabilities..
It's easy to understand
"Video is not clear like zoom, it feels like a heavy app compare to zoom. Teams does not have an option of using phone audio for small business customers or below 100 users in Saudi Arabia."
Some time works and many times dose not works.
Mobile app UI suddenly turning to blank and unable connect. - 24 September 2020
Video quality is fine but I couldn't see all options like chat and raise âœ‹ like we get in Windows.
Good for communicating with my coworkers but man does this app poop on my phone battery life
"Teams is a interesting app.but i have 2 serious issues about this app.i am using this app since 3 months.1st month was having the chat and suddenly the chat got disabled.so i am not able to chat with my friends.please refer to that.next complain, the person who is not the organiser can't able to share screen,mute others and other organising options.see that everyone have the right to be a organiser.please refer to my post and reply me create more apps like this app.thankyou for this oppurtunity."
Frustrating sometimes works other times not. But when working its good ðŸ˜‰ðŸŒˆðŸ™‚
too slow if you upload an attachment
"App does it's job, allowing me too keep in contact with my teams, however, struggles with some in call features. An example of this is switching between hands free and speaker modes in calls. Understandably, there are several types of Android devices and handling different combinations of device configurations will be tedious. With that I will not be hard on them for that. Unfortunately, it tends to crash while on calls possibly due to the device configurations."
"Teams is good, but lacks the finesse when replacing Skype. The Teams chat is very clunky and will overwhelm very quickly. The calls are better but the UI needs cleanup"
Call quality is not good
Good app but uses lot of net uses battery a lot so I am giving only 3 ðŸŒŸ
"Meh, use it for work"
Voice is to low without wearing earphone can't listen anything
Good
Good
Very Good
Nice
Good
Nice app this aap much More better than zoom app
"Overall the experience is pretty smooth , I only face problems while handing in assignment , it always fails , and after trying 3-4 times it finally accepts, Just look into this issue ."
"If someone removes us or mutes us , please mention the name of person who does it."
Very useful app for students during covid-19
Really gud !
Good
ðŸ‘
3 starts because I don't want to study but I didn't make it 1 because I can take with my friends
Do this app has a record feature while in video call?
most of the time it get auto close in the mid of the call
One should able to connect or transfer the call from mobile to PC. Rest is all good.
I wish there was a feature to test how our voice sounds.
Bad
Please deny the future of removing one attendee from the meeting by another attendee
Very good but sometimes it's have some issues. Overall nicely
This app is very nice but I cant see more options on this app which my friends can get
Man can't mail my teacher.
"App is good, using it for school classes.. I am using it on 2 different devices. Working fine in one and the voice is not going out from one device. I have checked setting as well. Need help to resolve this issue"
After the latest update the app is very rough and uncomfortable to use
"I'm constantly being removed from the meetings. When I join a meeting, after some 5 mins the call ends automatically. Please fix this."
"In school meeting and live classes, people are removing each other or people are being removed by some system error. We are facing difficulty during online exam. Kindly resolve the issue so that attendees can not remove each other."
"After update of teams and upgrade to android 10, it crashes again and again. Please fix this problem"
"Nice app but a bit difficult to understand, good app"
Take a new upgrade
No option as background affects come on my screen but on a PC or laptop it comes
It's quite good ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ
I'm basically using this app for my Online classes but it has many glitches and bugs which I think need to be solved and repaired. Like sometimes the screen gets blackout then some times the options to start video or audio options are not coming then I have to leave the meeting and again join it to repair this issue...and nowadays whatever I write in the reply box I can't see them myself...Pls fix these issues... Otherwise a good app..
i do not have any options
nice app for video class lessons
Communication quality is good at all
Really can talk with friends and do school things
Contains bug
"Please make the recorded classes available please it's hard to get everything in one go, so please make that feature available in MS teams"
Teams is great. Often difficult to work on teams on the phone. Could do with being able to use the phone or ipad in class as easily as a laptop
Ok
Very bad apps nob hrapics
To improve features
"Unable to connect MS teams with Samsung Level U while using on mobile, please provide solution"
"Everything is nice but just you need to add system audio option into this, please make a log of participants who remove other participants and also fix the glitches"
"Sometimes it just suddenly stops,the join button does not work sometimes"
Duplicate classes are being opened and the chats are not shown.
It is good but in since class it is strucking
Sometimes incoming video is very blur vice is clear
Good
It is not that bad app
It help us in COVID 19
Padha ne ka liya Q banai
"Its a really good app. But just today (24th september) when i opened teams on the computer for school, i noticed a new update which doesn't allow entering full screen while attending the meeting, which was useful because it the screen is small, we could enter full screen and then the content of the screen was really clear. Please update the app again and please give the option of full screen."
OK
Good but some problems like stuck echo etc are the problems . Sometimes we can't hear the teacher and ot
Disconnection is often
Not good but best
Experienced dead slowness during the remote sharing sessions. Web performance for better.
So. So
This app is really helpful I use to take lectures through this app
cannot add background ...
"You should come to the direct content only in the chat box , so our time should not be wasted in scrolling down to the content."
I use this app for college. It's pretty good but I think there's a bug where the mic unmute themselves without my input. I suggest adding a push to talk feature.
Many options are missing as it was told
Changes in PC app I cant enter in full screen in PC mode. Please update
Its not too bad to use. I wouldn't use it by itself. I use it as a companion to the desktop app for when I'm not at home.
"If I want to uninstall and download it again, when I download it it says waiting for download. Very irritating my network is high speed but still it says waiting for download. Please fix thisðŸ™"
"I use it for work, and the later versions are a great improvement. However, the calendar only shows the agenda of meetings. It would be great if the actual calendar was shown... Yet there's no option for that."
Not good Not bad.
Good app for collaboration. I keep having the issue where the app switches my headset audio to the device.
Good job
Sometimes the app closes abruptly
ease of use needs improving
Still not as easy to use as it could be....voice quality remains undependable
"Good app and easy to use, it feels better when ubuse the pc version tho"
"The file ( pdf ) i uploaded is not opening. It's saying that the file is not in a proper format. It is all happening after the updation, prior to this there was no problem regarding the uploaded files. I hope this issue gets fixed up as soon as possible, as it is really irritating. Now i am regretting after i updated this app."
"Everything is okay about this app, but the updates are making it worse. Now the recordings are not available in mobile MS teams and also the older chats vanished in the latest update."
Sometimes you can't hear the person giving the presentation so it makes it difficult for my son to do his work.
"please try to make it faster and lighter , sometimes some files take so long to load . thank you"
The application is just confusingly irritating.
ðŸ‘¦
"The app is great for having information at your finger tips, however the most important part the meeting has some issues. The last update has allowed me to at least join and listen to the meeting. However no matter what I do others can't hear me. Makes the phone app very unusable for meetings."
Lots of things need improvement
Its good
"I'd give it a 5 if it weren't for my difficulty using my bluetooth headset for audio. Most times when in a teams meeting, when I switch to bluetooth headset for audio, the headset will work for a moment but then it automatically switches back to device for audio. Makes it hard to use when on the move, or in a noisy area. This is the only app I've experienced this problem with. Headset works great on every other app. Please troubleshoot and fix, then I'll give it a 5."
Pdf file is nor opening... Please consider this and reply
"It's TEAMS. I still like Skype for Business better, but alas..."
I rate 3 star because I can't invite to other in this app
Not yet satisfied.
There is no form option in teams so plz give a update fast tommorow there is attendence we should submit it so plz add a form option in teams app itself thank you
I 've given 3 stars only for its clarity of sound but some times it irritates and makes trouble to join in the meetings . The call cuts unexpectedly and when any other call comes it automatically cuts and ask to rejoin. Always asks to sign in but when I sign in it shows there is a problem in signing in ...so pls solve my problems
Everything is great except for the away sstatus features...this should be in user hand only
Good
Nice but poor sound quality
Yeh Iys Hood And Bad....
Nice video calling platform for this pandemic. This is good for meetings and the features are nice but it has to be updated on the phone application and the video freezes in between net is full but there are several network issues on this app . I would recommend if they improve the quality and overall i loved the Callender option and change picture option Positive points Easy to access the meeting notes Can get all meetings scheduled in Callender Change dp Negative points Lags Network issues
It's good but we cannot able to install after once uninstalling it
Good app but many times hanged and coice not comes and not work
Good ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
"Nice app but one problem that i am facing from last 1 week that I am not able to open any assignment which my teacher is giving it's showing sorry,we cannot take you at this destination at this time..."
Team app is good. But Video call dont have Filters like Snapchat or Youcam. Please add filters and editing options for Girl employees.
Sometimes it hangs when logging in
Well this app is very very good ðŸ‘ðŸ˜however when i use it through my computer it works very very slowly causing me to get late in submitting my assignments and check the posts. ðŸ˜‘Not only this but also it frequently stops working and makes my other apps work slowly tooo. So i would request u to fix this problem as this problem gets onto my nervesðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–. Thank you
Good
Its good but on tablets and phones it doesn't work fully My chats don't load fully i have to keep going back and on it again
From last 4-5 months this app was working nicely but now it is hanging a lot and is not opening! My important work is pending! Please resolve this issue .From the day I installed this it was sometimes saying teams has stopped but later it would work .But now from today I don't know what happened that it is not working at all!
Memory consumption is higher. Application shall be light and smooth in operation.
"There are problems. Firstly there is no chat in the meetings. Secondly when I want to open a chat outside a call, the app crashes suddenly!"
I dreamed it
The next time you update this app please make it possible for android users to change their background and use the together mode
Can you make class materials in mobile teams also
I feel this is a good App for students.. video and sound clarity is very good. .
Nice app but delay in opening the application.
Calendar missed in new updates.
"Bluetooth earphone's mic is not working in PC version ðŸ˜’ never expect this from Microsoft Comparing with Google meet, teams user interface is not easy to use"
On mobile...it's works very fast....great...but on windows 10 on my laptop....very poor show...so 3 stars
No option to delete a message Crashes
It has a problem to signin
Good
Please add live chat it's not good to go back and chat it's really worst
Easy to use
It opens in middle for unnecessaryly please see Microsoft team
Nah
Really annoying every second notifications come . Sometimes it glitches and kicks you out of the meeting. So please fix that. Sometimes the chatbox icon doesn't appear.
Good but why isint respond
very good but has problem with RTL in chats
"It is useful for school, but I have one issue with it. The assignments don't show up unless you click on a specific subject, which is very annoying when you are trying to look up which prep you have for which subject. I suggest putting tick boxes in, plus a choose all/choose none option to save time."
You are exploiting out privacy by the following things. First that giving access to global admin to see our private chats okay tell me why ms whyyyy
It is a good app but not that much qualified. It first did not give the option to call someone personally but after some time it rechanged the settings and removed the calls option by itself
Sometimes sound problem from other end.
It sometimes takes time to sync. Apart from that its a very useful tool
Good
It deleted my classes wow like wowðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜±
"Unable to open in my phone coz its very difficult for open in other device like laptop and type because when you have 15 mins and 20 questions , are u nuts ? For video calling and other things i rated 3 star other wise you dont deserve 3 star also"
Display get dark due to light sensor activation... Please rectify it
"It keeps hanging up my calls everytime after a few minutes in the meeting. Because of which I'm unable to get notes and understand the concept of the subject which is affecting my studies. Please do something about it, this has been happening for 3 days straight and everytime I try to rejoin it keeps saying 'you have been denied access to the meeting'. I don't know what to do about this, because of this I have been unable to attend my classes properly. Please do something about this issue..."
I can't found recorded video..... before some time time recorded videos are available in chat but now there are not recorded videos...if our lecture miss then how can we attend it....so please add that feature again
Nyc app it's usable
Ok
This app is really amazing i really enjoyed this app for my school online study's and it has great featured but it has some problem occured that i can be unmuted sometimes so plz ms teams work on that featured. Plz other wise its perfect my study's.
First I have there is no back ground for mobile phones and it lagging please solve it and the chat is not available for ever time only open some hours only
Good
"Once I change my name,the people in the meeting cannot see the edited name.So please work on that issue"
Video calling please disable Is not showing screen sharing please fix bug
This app is quite good but it hangs my phone has 6gb ram
Needs improvment
Nice meeting app
Audio and vedio interuppted and any one can remove frm the meeting which is very difficult to reconnect again ... It's a big prblm for students who are in poor network area
"Why is delete whole chat option not available , i am taking classes the screen goes blank it shows i m out of the meeting while nobody is the presenter .why ?pls work on this there is one more lag whenver i am joining a meeting by mistake if i click on the cross sign then i am not able to join in any class that day this app literally is bad very bad but because of online classes i am stick to it or else i had deleted it the moment it started lagging"
Hey Microsoft team I will give you 5 star after some changes in this app the reason is when muting myself its automatically unmuted and when talking to some else the sound goes out and plz set messaging update and please set old update. Then I will give 5 star. Thankyou.
I have given 3 stars because 1 error is there in this aap that in any time I just go to Calendar option always I couldn't see the link of my classes
"My online classes happen on this app. I can't reset my password , just INCLUDE AN OPTION TO CONTACT ADMIN IN THIS APP"
It is a great app.
The app lags every time
THE TEAM WAS NOT VERY GOOD APP BECAUSE IT STUCKS AGAIN N AGAIN
I can't see background effect option in computer
It is a good app for work related stuff but it sometimes the system gets hanged which is a issue. Overall it works fine.
The app itself is cunky sometimes and not as useful as desktop app. But really good platform and services.
Sometimes can't see the board
The audio and video can be a little tricky sometimes
Fast and reliable. Would like to be a little more streamlined when moving from Assignment to Assignment. There is no option to have several elements of it open at same time ... ie posts/chat stream and Assignment. This would be handy when communicating with members about grades and assignments.
Slow connection error constantly
"Works good. We have to use it for work. Not everything works good. Bluetooth audio does not work. I looked online and it is a real problem, not just me."
Lots if echo.
the video keeps freezing.
The link was too slow to get
Error in Xiomi phone. please fix
It's buggy
I can't access recordings and sometimes files neither.
All over the app is awesome but I can't call anyone from teams in my device dont know what's the problem it's my request to please fix the problem. This is the major problem why I have given only 3 stars to it. If it works fully without no issues I'll surely give this app 10 out of 5 stars So see if the problem can be fixed
ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¥´
This app make me dissappointed because the person who remove me from class again and again and muting continously when i am.starting answering and due to this remove system i loss my attendence i am very disappointed about this point
It's gud
Well my 9 year old use it and it goes black some times so you need to change it
"The app works fine for meetings. The reason for the 3 stars is I use this for online university lessons, and teachers always record their lessons. To see all the lessons, I have to access the Stream service outside the app and there seems to be no way to download videos so I can access them without Internet, or even put them in order or rename them. Since I have many classes, this is very inconvenient because I have a hard time finding the right videos when I need them."
Good apps
It's is a nice app but sometimes it didn't function well. It's recorded meeting is not visible on moblies now-a-days. Sometimes sound is disorted in the meetings. Some have trouble joining the meeting and inviting.
im not able to update it
It consumes a lot of mobile data. As compared to Gmeet it's consumes less amount of data still people having only Mobile data as a connection need to suffer.
Too unstable on android. Too slow on mac
Only one problem in this app that the join link not visible any time .but we talk about the app is very good compare to others
Good app
No No No
"i like it but when im using somethig other than a computer or laptop, i cant open the chat room."
"Great application. Just a suggestion: when raising a hand, then you speak, perhaps it should automatically go away once you open unmute."
Great for working from home and trying to connect. Videos dont do well when sharing.
I am unable to share files to external contacts.
Pretty good but sucks on school ipad
I am not able to find the option of virtual background in teams
On the cellphone connection is excellent but when using HP laptop not so good audio quality and connection cut during meetings.
It's not showing live chat please fix this issue
Iam unable to see the video call recordings that was recorded by my teachers in my mobile but I can see them in pc . Can you say why?(I prefer mobile)
Today the calls didn't work and I had to tell smbdy to invite me for the Last 3 classes and chat doesn't work and I can't open anything but the days before it worked amazingly
Overall a good app but has slowed down dramatically since the last update!
"It was an amazing app but the only problem was , it consuming high data"
It's a good app but I could not view the assignment posted by my teacher and sometimes I don't get join option
Too complicated to install and register new account
"Keep getting the ""Call anyone from Teams using your new number"" screen everytime I launch the app even though I've gone through the 3 screens and pressed ""Got it"". Company recently enabled the option, but the app is not remembering that I've seen the screen already. Apart from that it's good."
"Its a horrible app. It uses a lots of data and also excessive bttattery consumption. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž I am forced to use this app because of my online classes, but in my opinion zoom and Google meet and others are better options..... Needs improvement."
One major problem (as described by someone else also) is that the chat always shows the earliest messages first and we have to go all the way down to see the newest messages.
Need improvement in this app please try to improve more

How do i participate in meeting if i.cant type.
Nice
App is goob. There is no chat box .
It doesn't work in background even when my app settings permit it to do so. It used to work in the background before but now it doesn't.
It takes more data please see this problem
It is very hard to use for me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Please add temas browser app to every browser
Feeling latency while loading. Other apps are doing fine
Good app
easy to operate
It is good and worth using
This app is amazing but I have given 3 stars because when we use it on mobile or tablet there are no option for quick pin and there is not at all an option for background on mobile or tab it reduces data when turn on video and call ends unexpectedly
Okay okay But a lot of technical issues
Some times it doesn't support bluetooth connectivity
"It's a very nice app but does not allow mobiles,tabs to change the background in call"
Good
This is a good app but consumes a lot data Like it but if there is little connectivity issues the meeting got disconnected I can conclude all over it is good
good but video quality is poor
"Missing 1.Picture in picture mode over other apps, and 2.mic blinking(like in zoom) when organiser speaks .."
"This app is good but some times it does not work even if the internet is there , so I gave 3 stars."
Good morning friends with the help you out of my life in a few days ago by a few of the most part of the tree and I even have a great day and the rest of e roju vodu your email ðŸ“§ to be a little

A very poor app
"Btw Iâ€™m Satish mudgals daughter in 5th grade, when our online classes started I started using teams app , so I was really excited about it and the first few months I found it pretty nice but then I discovered A few problems I confirmed my network it was perfect ( as per my dad ) and checked if there is any problem with my own device but no then my father understood that because of some type internet based virus had gotten into my teams app , and my app wasn't functioning well , but it is ok"
Good
It can be better
Nice app bro Wonder fullðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜Š
Sometimes it gets glitch
It is not so good either to bad but there will be problem after using this app for 3 months or more so good luck
The chat has a huge lag. I see the new message as notifaction in an ongoing meeting but the same is not visible in the chat. Fix It.
Good
Best no.1 this app for injoy your life
I deducted 2 stars...because sometimes either the recordings are not saved or if it is saved ..then also they are not of as good quality as the live class...because of which kids start losing their interest to do the revision from the recordings..
Need improvements
Nice
Its so hard finding downloaded items. Change the download location to the default mobile download folder. Also i need a way to respond to a particular message on the desktop app. Same way i can swipe on a a message om the mobile app and am able to reply to it
When ever I am in a metting and if I press right side bottom the add participants button will open and I don't know why or else it is super ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
GOOD FOR OFFICE WORK
Good application for office and educational purposes It is helpful
Good
Both hard apo
Samir boss ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ¨
"The app is good but when there is too many poeple on it, it take you out of it. Then you have to open it again and it take a while."
It help me in all work of school but it don't allow me turn on video as well as other app. à¤®à¥‡ à¤‡à¤¸ aap à¤®à¥‡à¤‚ à¤µà¥€à¤¡à¤¿à¤¯à¥‹ on krke koi dusra app nhi chala skta it's very big problem
Good
Nice apps ðŸ‘
Very good app
My video is breaking always

Nice app
Before august the app was running good on my pc i dont know why there i got a new type of meeting which is irritating please check that
"I want to recover one of my accounts, but forgot my password. The procedure to recover is too clumsy. It fails every time as I don't remember everything it asks. Please give a simple way to recover. I will give my email ID. you send OTP to my email to recover. Obviously, my email ID pass word is secured only with me. So, why this complex way to recover? Please sort it out."
Accessible and convinient to use
please add a background changer on the Android version to make it more like beautiful but everything is ok not until it wont respond
"Good product, but there are a few deficiencies. Communicating code blocks using backticks is unintuitive and hard to explain to students compared with almost every other chat platform. The problem is that the chat box tries to reinterpret your markdown-style syntax as you type, and this causes a lot of issues when communicating anything in code. This could be easily fixed with a setting to disable real-time chat interpretation of markdown. Also code blocks on mobile don't work."
functional but poorly adapted to my Pixel Slate.
Cause there's no option for removing the profile pictures
"Can you (Microsoft) please remove sign slash '/' from your application version? I have never seen another Android app version to include this sign. Even in any version of Windows OS, this is not valid symbol for a filename. Otherwise, this mobile app is convenient and easy to use."
It is cool cos that there's a friend at USA and now you feel like your withe herðŸ˜ƒ
"Good app. Many good features. But the problem is that threre are too many restrictions. Once forgot the password, it is difficult for one to reset it."
Needs update. Bug fixes and all that . Because members have joined the meeting and I can only view 6. Fix it asap. I'd to pin my baby
Creation of new chat group is not intuitive.
"Useful app. Annoyingly it has begun to launch itself when I unlock my phone, even while signed out."
it glitches alot but overall i am able to join my classes
"Good potential, yet glitchy. The Shifts app doesn't have the same options as the web version; significant IM delivery delay vs the desktop app, while connected to the same network."
I cannot share my screen / ppt ðŸ™ƒðŸ‘ŒPlease fix it!!!!
Okkkkk-ish it does have loads of flaws too many to give even 3.5/5 I recommend using discord instead
Wow
Good
"This app has been critical for the company I work for since working remotely due to COVID. Being able to answer work calls from home using my cell phone and being able to transfer calls to coworkers is awesome! But every so often, I won't get calls, just notifications that I missed a call. I have to reinstall several times before I'm able to get a call. This is a big deal!!! This is the only issue I've had with this app."
"Mostly love. Only hitch... and its kinda big, once or twice I've been on a call and hung up, but I still show on the call to co workers. I had to restart my phone to get it to hang up."
Teams is being used as officaly..we make calls internally what about calling vendors and others onsite let me know how we can se if you have this feature as well
Jamas lo.he usado para algo util. Ni se bien como funciona o para que. Creo que solo ocupa lugar y ya
The app keeps saying the mobile number is already in use and it's not verifying my account.
"When it accumulates a lot of user data, the app starts to desynchronize with the feed, and one needs to force stop the app and then delete cache for forcing it to re-synch. Also no way to filter important messages from common messages."
Nice wonderfull app but it is causing problem to my live classes and also the call automatically gets declined
lag specially many users type inquiries or questions
Yeah kinda cool
Not best but good
We can meet class effectively
It is just good
Not bad .....
it is perfect app but need to enhancment as add filter by date or name in files.. need to can share meeting invitation or get link by easy way espacial in desktop app. some times app can't work
"Constant problems opening Word DOcuments for class work, Teachers and students alike have trouble turning in and recieving Assignments. Lack of Notifications for assignments. Constant ill responses from the app. I give it three stars because times are crazy, and i know Microsoft Tech staff are working hard to fix these bugs!"
It is a good app for better interaction but it should have its own white board coz screen lacking is there
Good
Nice app but it gets stuck ðŸ‘Ž
Lot of clitches while using app in system.
At first it was working fluently but then it had a glitch which fixed but after that too my call dropped unexpectedly i heard others echo and the screen kept freezing pls fix the problem ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

It was working fine but I am unable to invite people to the meeting. Everytime i try they say the user is already in the call while they're are not
"It's a rediculous app I hate it it have many problems but rarely. Today was my exam and because if this bad app I missed it, it showed something went wrong whenever I tried to open Assignments section. It's a rediculous app."
I like appðŸ˜ƒ

hmmm now i see that the producers arent going to add virtual backgrounds in Chromebook OS and it needs very good nw for working or else even at normal nw if someones speaking voice crack sometimes hangs even ppt resentation or the screen
Its a great app I use it to attend my online classes It has an option to give online exams also......but in the recent days...I'm facing many problems in it. It keeps hanging and I can't see the conversation in the different channels. I think it is because of the new update. Because of the new update......its not user-friendly. Please look over this matter.
Its easy to use. But data is consuming than before please update it as we all use mobile data for attending class. It will be very helpful.
This app good only that when sending pages more than 1 the pages get mixed up
"I wish the use of this app is only for work meetings ðŸ˜ðŸ˜. Anyways it is well organized, better than other meetings apps so keep it up guys ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰"

It's one of the best apps I have used for meeting.But I would like to suggest that app needs to more optimized for smartphone.Also navigation through various tabs should be improved.

It is a very good app Best for video conferences One problem that there is hardly anything to delete which are not required Also chats can be easily removed by administrator. Anybody can remove anybody.

Doesn't sync well with updates in the desktop app
Good
Good but there was some problems
Good app but I have been laging alot since my old house with the best internet on my house and there some times where buttons dont work and some times the camera or share screen doesn't work and when I am in meeting I need to minimise or close the app to go to chat at PC pls fix these
It is nice but it get hang or stuck
Didn't let me log in at all and I had to do it on Google
"I am a student Nice app, But sometime it get hanged and chat is not working.. ðŸ˜¡"
It is very nice but it is very slow in working. Doesn't work properly in calls.
Need more updates to be stable
You should do more work on Video recording cz after i started video recording after the end of lecture recording disappeared
It's nice but we can't delete our conversation
Free download 10000
"So far good, but there is lot to enhance the application."
But some glitches comes
It is great Just 1 problem in chat When i am in meeting any message comes i cant see only Then i go too chat side then it's a problem IS IT HELP FULL ??
"Pretty good overall with some major things missing: breakout rooms, more control over files (specific permissions), major platform discrepancies(settings that only exist in desktop/web/mobile), control over items showing/hiding"
"Microsoft Teams is a well-built app where we can organize things easily. It allows teachers to post assignment, Meet and do private calls and it is an all-in-one app that connects all microsoft products. But it takes a huge amount of data. A curse for those who don't jave broadband. Kindly find a solution. Google meet can work with a small amount of data but if this was possible in teams too, then it is first class app."
Connectivity is hit and miss. I often don't receive notifications.
Doesn't support many participants
Keeps crashing
In the phone ðŸ“± raise âœ‹ hand option is not there . In the phone ðŸ“± when someone share screen we have to pin it
Nice app
Resently I've been having a problem where I can't edit a message I send or delete it and yes I have tried updating and reinstalling the app an even restarting my phone but it still dosen't work please fix this.
Best app for studying
This is a very good app for online classes ðŸ˜ƒ

Hii Frankie trover sa bola ki class chaile you have a good day to you and your family are doing good u you have a y I have to be a little Nhhzlzhaksbks while y I have to be a little while to get the chance of
I'm not able to get the updates well....and also I'd be even happier with app if we are able to move the mic and the video and etc options if we are in the call window.....the new update is coming for only some people....that's all I want to say...other all things are good....thank you.
"Nice app, but UI is cluttered."
"You should work on one thing See some teachers are there so sometimes they forget to change settings so the students try to mute teacher and try to remove other students...so you should show the name of the student who is doing that instead of using ""someone"""
We can't type messages and complains to the teachers in the chat section so I gave 3 stars
cant navigate team member's video stream
Good ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ cannot delete the chat...
Ok
"It is good but it sometimes doesn't work properly unless on a computer and that's annoying. Also, files never open on my phone."
Right
Creativity and management is displayed in this app but it lacks a bit of development.
Good
It is good for school meetings but the meeting chat is disabled & I have go to the teams and then chat & I have to download the recording
The video is freezing
Please make a change that if the organizer or teacher had let you in one time then you don't have to ask permission again if for some reason they left the meeting or class (mostly connection issue) or the call has dropped.
Because someone time in file not open or download
Nice
This is improved app
Not working properly ... In middle only it gets log out and there are many problems ...it not download videos given by teacher
Awesome
App is nice but I have changed my name but it can't recognise even after 24 hours .This bug may lead to the absence of my attendance in my presence ðŸ˜¬ . It's very frustrating
It was very easy to use
Its amazing but the reason why i gave it only 3 stars is that it lags too much and does nt respond many a times. Also it takes a lot of space.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
Nice
Good
Hi! I have been using for my online classes on this platform. There is always mic issue. Sometimes gets glitched or cannot hear the other person at all. Also my net gets consumed a lot from your app. Please fix these issues.
Very good
It's just okay. we can't even download the the file in our device and we can't open any file offline no matter how many times we opened it before It uses too much data.file opening is just a frustrating in this app.if they work on these things it can be a good app maybe
Other person's video gets paused periodically.. And is sometimes difficult to join a call. Isn't really systematic... Cannot see every person's video in the meeting.
It is nice but taking more time
I can't find recording video in chat. How to find recording videos
It 's very use full app for study
The old version of the app was far better than the new one....even the attendees in the meeting can mute the participants...it gets very disturbing some times
Some functions are not working in the app.
There should be a reminder for organiser too that they are exceeding time..
Fine
Bettry consumption
App is good... But there is no option to remove the organizer.. There is only remove to participate.. Plz put the option and add some camera filters....
Good apps
Good
It has more glitch and can you please update the updates which in windows 7
I have faced the same problem number of times....the problem is only with the Bluetooth connectivity.... everytime we connect our Bluetooth to the device...we can't switch the audio output from the microphone to the Bluetooth device we are wearing...look into this issue and fix it soon Thank you â˜ºï¸
Not good enough
Fantastic
Its a nice app for online classes its very useful in lockdown
It is completely safe and secure for the online classes and the other tasks to be carried ðŸ™‚
this is a good app for online classes though I will give 3stars because there is no screen sharing
Nice
It useful 4this online classes. But not able ti view the recorded meetings
Nice
Nice
The ppt presentation in this app is very unclear....
If you leave it on chat or on Posts you will only gerr notifications for that tab. So be sure to leave it in a generic mode. It makes too much noise during zoom.
"The teams app is good. However I cannot set up a personal profile even with a separate email address on another device. Teams should allow us to switch between profiles, official and personal and avail of the features and functions of the app. Currently I cannot use teams for my personal use as it keeps conflicting with my work account."
so many sound problem
Nice call
This app is okay for education purpose but it is doesn't work in low internet connection. Then this app is very good _:-)
Nice
Ok Kmo
It's the okayest messengering app ever!
Can't reliably open a form through teams app. Open in browser works though but then the app is hung until I kill it and restart.
The app features are nice but the problem I faced was in recordings... Before it used to record soon and we were able to open those recordings in stream app easily but now to view recordings there is only one way to view it that is to download that too it expires within 20 days.... Please fix this bug ..for this reason I have given three starts ... Thanks
i smell poop nvm butr teams is idk
Quite ok
I need to add more than one its not accept
Mostly stable sometimes not
I love this app because I have online class on it
Good app
It's a great app....there are some technical glitches to be solved.
"Poor optimization, notification issues."
"Teams screen share image distorted view in android version when I am attending teams meeting using android phone version 10 .Whenever someone shares a screen to me, other users who are using desktop are seeing the normal view of the screen. I am seeing a slanted or distorted view. Please fix"
No comment
Plese can you make it size smaller
This app is really good very good but what the post are posted they will be disappeared after 20 days or few more days plzz make changes about all the revice plz make all changes fast all means all the review people's told
"It is a very useful app. I can do the class nicely in this app. But one problem is that if anyday there is bad or good weather , this app don't work But there is good network and others app work in that day also . I am suffering with me some days . So kindly see on this then I will be happy."
Not bad
Good app
ok app great tools. some audio lag and crashing while in teams but not in calender meetings.
It's great before but now it is randomly signing me out and making me restart my initial setup again.
Good
"Not too good, there are lots of glitches on my laptop, most of the time it keeps restarting"
"It is good but I have many problems like live captions doesn't work, and blur option is not coming in windows 7"
Good ok ok ok ðŸ‘arogya is good at this pandamic stage and it is also useful for people who have some symptoms and need to check
Closing app upon sending attach files; please fix this problem asap!...
Update of teams profile is not reflecting
"Teams is not running in the background, there is no option in the settings to enable running the application in the background. Android system already identified the same issue and sent the bug report to MS teams"
Video quality is not good
I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars because in the mobile version you can't access the files
Nice app for study
Been using for some time now. Feeling like this could be my go to for getting together with others
Please get limited time for meetings and days
"Please introduce an option of ""Pause Share"" when I am sharing"
The aduio is kind of broken as if it is like cutting some of the the words people are saying
The best app ever
"Teams is a good app but teams has to improve for custom background , whenever I add a custom background it tells couldn't upload image , please Microsoft corporation work on it"
OK so basically whenever I am trying to do something it directly moves to a loading screen it's really annoying and it really isn't user friendly
Good app for teaching purpose
"Works well for chat, video and audio calls. Could use some improvement in chat messages that shows time on individual chat messages"
I like it
Bidhan Chandra Paul
"Connects quite well. The interface needs work, as it doesn't come across as either professional or with class, like Slack"
Great
Good aap But improve some features.
Its a good app for meeting but in the meeting anybody can remove any body there must be a feature in only teachers and organizers can remove anybody plz make a update of this i request to youmicrosoft carporation plz listen to my words and a make solution of this thing
Still needs more Integration
Right
why is that i can't view or watch the recorded video that have taken? all of it
It is OK. But it is very slow. I.e if a meeting was scheduled for 10.00am it wills show meeting at 10.10am
It has a good view
Nice app but sometimes there is a connection problem but only sometimes ðŸ˜Š
It consumes a lot of data
App is good and user-friendly. Need to improve screen sharing features and control taken by other. That's not work well l. Other things are doing great... hoping for improvement..
It consumes much data For 30-40 min class it take almost 400mb of data..
It's a little bit slow in meetings and it shows notifications lately
"Some glitches is there, try to avoid that!"
Very good app... Either for education or software.....But after update isn't very good.....
It is very good
Its much clear than other
There should be a resolution adjuster ... Becoz slides eats up the network causing lag..
"Conceptually it's a great app. Unfortunately it has some faults that need to be fixed. Main one is that it is heavy and often crashes. Often it also doesn't connect to the network and doesn't show any new messages; I have to close the app and reopen. If these issues will be fixed, for me it would be a 5 star app"
You don't have the option to share screen/ video with sound. I find it difficult to share a video with sound everytime. Certain options are not available on phones that are otherwise available on big screens which is not good.
Feels good but consume too much data
More data consumption

"I like this app. Actually, I would give it 5 stars, but it causes a lot of basic problems. I use this app for my school studies. But, it causes a lot of technical issues."
nice
OK for students
Video quality is not so good but better than other apps â˜º
Nice but not that much good
3 stars cause it is good but takes a lot of internet to work properly
Some features not available
nice app. but getto was an no screen size.but so much data 400 data in one meating
Please give background blur and change option
Please give background change option for Android.
Nice for studing
"I'm giving a three star.Is it possible for seeing every person's video,we can only see 6 members,no slide to see the other ones."
Not sign in the teams account properly but it was helpful in lockdown pandemic situation
#good
"It's a very good way attending classes, meet many people through this simple process. But sometimes the voice echoes, the video freezes in good connectivity so it sometimes becomes a little bit difficult to attend the meetings"
Please add delete chat option.
Good app
Again and again the app is not working it to hard to join class or presantations this app is not so good and not so bad
"I dont have any problem in Android basicly, but in window version too slow and consumed lot of memory and network usage, at least 1.4 Mbps average everytime conference call"
It's so laggy
"This was so good, but in my other device I makes my tablet mo logging please fix it"
Good app but should also add background effect in phone app Then i will give it 5 stars Or I can give 7 stars also Not responded yet so reduced 1 star
Good
It good but it's so slow . And it drops you out of calls but over all it's great for assignments and meetings and notes . Notes also has problems with being slow and not saving things but once you get the hang of it it's good .
Good for school classes
"Pretty good user experience, but the backend is buggy sometimes and lack of calendar and meeting scheduling for free teams is disappointing"
I would like to recommend the app to take less wifi and to be more easy to log in it
Fine
in overall this app is really good but i prefer zoom instead of microsoft teams because the quality of the chat and face is better but if your in school and you have assignments microsoft teams might win that battle and one error from microsoft teams is that if your doing a assignment some won't let you write
Real hit or miss performance.
I would give it 5 stars cause it's a great app but there's a lot of glitches and I get them in meetings with my teachers.
"Where is my recorded meetings!!ðŸ˜³ After recording the meetings, I can't find the recorded data in the teams app now a daysðŸ™†â€â™‚ï¸"
It's a good app can help me connect with people.... But it needs some updates because when we join a meeting the people on the others side can't hear me and when I try and rejoin I'm not able to do that. Not only that but I am not able to share my screen even if I am a presenter... There are many other problems too. Pls try and fix these issues.
There is no option given to tag have myself. And issue in recording meeting that it can't record single screen.
good
It really amazing but some
"It's a good just that are a bit a technical issues and having to scroll through the chat each time to see the new messenges om mobile is really tedious, please fix this issue."
Cool
I do not know how to open rooms for group discussion during training.
It's really leggy on my computer and my phone and editing it's hard with this app I would have gave it 4 but it is just too leggy
Its ok still have some fixing to do.
Its good But i request that please add the change background option on mobile too
where can I find the recorded version??
It keeps crashing and i can't see the content that is being shared almost everytime.
"This app is very nice app for online clasess and microsoft teams is communication and collaboration platform that combines workplace chat ,video meeting , file storage and application integration and the new feature for personal use are available in the same microsoft teams app you use for work or school so I Like this app very much."
Good
Good app but not best that's why I am not giving 5 star
Definitely very useful but during meeting in progress mic doesn't responding properly it's is the only problem
Not bad
Good to use..
I cant put backgrounds on my tab
Sharing issues are alot
There is an anudio bug. The auduio does not switch to bluetooth device when connecting to a meeting. It is set in Bluetooth audio but the the audio comes through the speaker on the top of the phone. I had to switch it back to normal speaker and back to bluetooth to actually hear it.
It is nice app and but connected 8 people
This app is using high data quantity but video not cleares. As not like zoom competition.
Good
App not downlod
This app takes a lot of time to load that's something that I hate about this app
I really love this app but why the video record doesn't appear in android So I have to download it frow web version I hope it can better than now
"On phone its excellent , in laptop also its good but sometimes it behaves abnormally in laptop like calls cant be made , cant join meetings and works only after restart. Plus meeting forward option is also not there in team calendar."
I am not able to choose background effect in ms teams
Why this apps often error???
"Although this app is most of the time useful, it has too many bugs. Recently, it has made my phone restart as soon as I open the app. Please try to fix this as I need to use it for my school work"
It is good aap for study But I want to change my profile desplay name But it is not changing
Some times good then many of the times getting very disappointed
When I have Teams open on my laptop and am literally within a live conversation I don't want Teams on my Android phone to buzz constantly for every message I'm getting within that live conversation. Didn't find any good way to keep teams muted on my phone when I'm active on teams on another device.
"Screen sharing is not working properly, shared screen is skewed"
Good app but l can not change my profile picture on a phone please improve on that
Working on files while sharing is a problem

"The lectures don't notify before starting and also after the recent update the live captions are not following where the captions go but are stuck at the beginning caption. App keeps crashing. 3 stars for it, please fix this and I will 5 star. Altogether is a great app!"
Sometimes meetings get disconnected in good network also.... It irritates me a lot. Reason for 3 star is it consume less data that is the good point about this app!..
"It can be bit more improved in terms of ui , audio call and video call"
It's good but it have lots of glitches
"The performance of this app is quite slow, and it's inconvenient that I occasionally don't receive notifications when a meeting has started."
Noice
Pagal
This is a nice app but I always hear a echo whenever I attend a class.
It's good something I don't like it
Good app
Bored
It have not a sufficient idea to upload files
"saya beri 3 bintang. Karena setiap saya masuk ke aplikasi ini, saya harus menunggu selama hampir 30 menit tapi pada akhirnya saya tidak bisa masuk ke aplikasi Teams. Saya harus meng uninstall dulu aplikasi ini lalu saya install lagi. Bagaimana cara mengatasi kendala ini? Tolong di perbaiki, agar saya nyaman menggunakan aplikasi ini untuk mengerjakan tugas. Terimakasih."
Work more for mobile phone background effect
"I have given three star as it has attendees and presenters. Anybody removes anyone as he is presenters. If a child is attendee, and if the child wants to call his friend he can't. So I request you to allow everyone to be presenters, but they can't remove anyone, the removing can be only done by organisers."
Not too good.......stop a lot nd need to have update afer a small period of tym....nd take a lot of MB
"Sometime, join button showed late. But it still show by the end."

No feature to delete chat history
It is a good app. However for past 1 month my son is unable to view the recorded lectures. He is in class 10th. And this has really become a problem. He can't even see the option for downloading the lecture. If possible please comment and help
Can I know the reason why my name is displayed as unknown in my group
Good
"Does all we need it to and more safely than others in this market. Calendar, Chat, Team creation, video and audio meetings, participant lists, etc. Reduced rating due to recent updates that require me to perform 2 factor identification every day when launched."
"It starts off well but as I progress the connection is affected and I get the message ""connection running low"" which leads to me being thrown out of a meeting"
At times it gets struck in between. It is suitable for learned students but does not facilitate others. If someone has forgotten her password then it is the least liked app.
Ok good
i think teams is ok zooms quality is way better
Cant login my account
why there's no fiture to download recorded video on mobile apps ? ðŸ˜”
Good
"Amazing app! Sometimes it's a bit hard to control and change settings but that's fine. By the way, how do you change the taskbar? What I mean is, how do I put it on top or bottom? I can't find it in settings."
Good
I am not able to see the recorded video of the previous day and can see the recording of the previous month.

It is a good app. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ™‹
"Stop pop up pls, its not profesional"
"It is very good app from this app i can study very easily and i can call ,chatand videocall can do"
This app is superb but want to give update option
Very difficult to use
It requires me to put in my password out of nowhere .
For me teams symbol is not visible in task bar which is located at bottom. Can you please say how to enable it
It's been good ever since i've been using it
Unable to get the notifications in Android application. Tried all settings but still the notifications are not notifying when the app is not used... This is a bug that has to be rectified
It's a pretty cool app
This is good app With lot of issues build in after updates
"I'm using Oneplus 7 mobile., And Oneplus Z headset., Not audible in Bluetooth headset., Kindly fix this error"
Uses too many resources to load thats why it becomes slow while loading files and opening menus etc
Good app to connect with team but you cannot delete a chat if you want to. You can only delete individual msgs in a chat.
It's updates are not good... I am not satisfied.... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜¢â˜¹ï¸
But In microsoft this function is not there in which we can see who see our profile
"Very glitchy, doesn't works properly with assignment submission and takes time to show the teams in which we are in... Yet 3 stars for the quality of meeting, no problems with conducting meetings..."
Its still lags and it needs improvement on connectivity issues
"Fine but what you preview on the camera isn't what other people see. So you think they can see you fine, they can just see your chin."
I Cannot See The Meetings After The Update
Good app
Good nd less consuming
It is good.. But often mobile reports your app is memory intensive.. Pls do something for that.
"Features are good but i am not satisfied with the performance .First of all it consumes large amount of data.Secondly it is very slow,it keeps on hanging.It is my request to devolopers to improve its performance especially speed because it consumes lot of time. Thank You."
Good but how to change the background of the video while being an attendee.
Ø±Ø§Ø¦Ø¹
I like to see class
Good app but is loading Time is trun in late
I am not upload to view my assignments. This app has more limitations than the desktop app.
"While on call, if you connect a bluetooth headset, you have to quit the call and restart the app to and rejoin the call."
When the network issue is poor on the opposite side of the organiser then the problems reflect in d presenter side too i.e) students.. Otherwise the app is cool ðŸ˜Ž..
Files stored on desktop app are not visible on mobile app and problems faced while switching to different files while working
It is an amazing app but it is now assignment.
This app is very nice for my online school classes
It is very best app for pc and Android
"Haii...I will give 3 stars for this app,...when I started using this app for my online classes....it was soo good..but this new version is creating a lot of problems...chat option is hidden and teachers can't use the whiteboard as it's resolution given by the app is very low...and they are struggling to teach students without using the board...so I kindly request you to rectify the problems I mentioned above as it is very important for students studying in class 10&12th especially Thank you"
Nice app
it is ver nice but always is blurry and voice breaks a lot
"Data consumption or data requisition is too much. However, a fabulous app in urban landscape."
"Nice app. But could've given five stars but didn't due to two faults. It happens sometimes that when a meeting ends, you find the video icon still there on the next day, and this video icon means there is some meeting being held amd it's confusing because then you don't know the real meeting is being held where. One more problem is that you can't know if someone messages you on mobile, and you know it only when you use a laptop. If these problems are fixed, Teams can deserv five stars from me."
Teams prompts login when working something else on phone. Pls fix this bug.
"This app need improvements. There are too many places for meetings, and it's hard to find them sometimes. But nice app anyway."
Ok
I like this app but it's chat is gone
This app is very helpful for our studies I like this app.
Team app is very good for online activities.
"Sometimes, Microsoft teams app doesn't respond"
It lags alot and sometime signs out it self
Nice app for meetings
"Good.., nice aap"
Today app getting more notifications from Fcm test notifications.if any review is conducted then it shouldn't effect on the real time apps

The sharing of documents is the worst part of all time
not gud video quality Needs a very good network
Good app but in between it is not opening. That is very disgusting problem. That's why I have given 3 stars Try to do better its graphics and other things. Because in my friends mobile it is showing u are no longer a participant Plz remind it. But nice app for online class
Super
Nice app
In this there must be a system throgh which we can find the name of participants who removed us from meeting or muting us
Good app but the video is not that clear
3 starts because virtual background is not available for all users
This is the best app for meting
"app is fine but while downloading files one faces so much of difficulty , particularly while downloading large videos. first of all the video size is not known untill the video gets downloaded offline & second is by any chance connection gets interrupted by call or anything ,the downloading stops and video will get deleted."
This is amazing app. But video quality is low. And this app used low net compare to zoom app. So it is good..... ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
it very helpful our keeping learn and use the studying but video quality is some low
Little bit nice
Worst app

Space for memory (working set-taskmanager) too high than zoom
"It's good but it keeps crashing all the time. If I open another app and return to teams, it'll immediately crash. Hoping that you could solve this crashing issue, Kudos!"
Ms team in my laptop is so complicated. I can't view posted posts in the teams.
Works well but it's sometimes confusing. I can't make voice messages on my desktop app
DeberÃ­a tener mÃ¡s funcionalidades de la versiÃ³n de escritorio
Useful and easy to navigate. Audio could be clearer at times.
"A little dull and booring, need more emoji's and little chess to interact with friends or something, and also please add level of volume on the app notifications is hurting my ears."
It's good but I think it needs more improvements in athe AI and meetings Also the chat says disabled so I have to uninstall the app and then reinstall for it to work
Work good. Not a techie. If you can improve than better else its good. No expectations.
The loading speed and message opening is not satisfactory but overall app performance is slowly improving.
"it's really distorted .it's safe ,but lots of technical issues"
Good!!!!ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ» But can be more better (in case of icon during Meet and chat too)
Looks great but how i can change the language to regional language like we can do in desktop application???
"Cuando se reproduce un video, no es posible verlo continuamente, se congela la pantalla unos momentos"
This app is like 50 50 not so bad not so good ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒVsðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

"All functions are very nice, but I need (back ground set up) in android phone , this is the disadvantage of the Ms team app because in laptop there is background set up so only,but I like all functions and this app also very useful for students ,officers are etc...ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ¤ðŸ»ðŸ¤ðŸ»"
"It's confusing to use, all the functions are there but you have to search for them. It's not intuitive. There are room for improvement."
It's a best app for online classes
Nice app.. very useful for office work
Some times difficult to use in areas with weak internet and I hope it can integrate task management instead of separate platform.
Good...Im in the sign language translation work. So i wish MT could host at least 30 video calls at a time. But overall this is a great app. I see MT now hosts more video calls. Nice. But still need more. :-)
"It's okay,but having some issues as well"
Video strucks sometime
Good App

Asmr crunchy ice-cream
Very slow to download
Good
Super app
Perfect. The only issue I faced while making assignment for one of my classes is that if I wanted to add a member after posting an assignment the new members doesn't get included unless I re-upload the assignment and change the time..
The app is very useful for me. I'm a student only. I hope this app is useful for every student. But one thing is it is struggling during on the video
Works ok. Add option to select video's/audio's quality/bitrate.
It would be fun to be able to do more!
This is very usefull but some times mike is disconnected
It is very useful for online classes
High speed internet connection is required to use the app.
The app is great.
Using my phone the connection is better but when I use VPN connection the rating is 1
"Slow functioning, takes time before the app opens"
"There had been a lot of glitches lately at the desktop app. It would restart and close on its own and load from there then close once again. After our online classes, the recorded sessions fail to upload too. It's a good platform in general to hold our online classes but the glitches are constantly happening more often whereas I had to uninstall and install the app on my desktop several times due to the glitching. Hope this gets fixed."
I like it because you can share almost anything but if network is low calls don't dial through at all.
I am suffering a lots of glicthes one of it is in the chat option it is showing you are not a participent . And cant able to message anyone . Please solve it quickly i want some notes from my friend .
During this pandemic situation this app is used for our online classes and I find it very useful .

Good
"It is a nice app. Though , some issues it has are really annoying. Like , we cannot delete any file that we have uploaded ( which can be done only on the web version). We have to select the audio type ( device, speaker etc) , whenever we are joining a meeting. So , thats why I gave an overall rating of 3 star . Hope the issues are resolved , otherwise it's a good app :)"
It stops working in the middle of the meeting even when there is a good network connection. Please work on it.
"1. Attendee, presenter and guest system 2. Waiting in lobby system (It create a lot of disturbance for the organizer) 3. Remove others system (Some students continuously remove other students ) 4. Mute all (even some students mute the teacher which create a lot of disturbance. ) Good points about the app 1. Good quality of video and audio 2. Private chatting with teachers ( For clearing doughts ) 3.Recording the things done by students and teachers Overall mix reactions for the app"
Its gr8 to work teams but the problem faced is that it hangs a lot kindly look after this....
Good

This app is very good but it consumes high data and battery power due to which some technical problems or errors may occur...
Please improve security Somebody hacked my account Please add more options in login
"Even in good network.. Sound problems, screen present too late, get frozen some time.. Kindly improve such quality.."
There is. Serious problem with Bluetooth connectivity. Every day I have to re install the app.
"While using through cell phone, I need to Login everytime without which I am hardly able to receive any chat notification but no calls at all without Login."

The problem/delay in see a new recording of meetings. The new post are in bottom that should be front or top.
"This best and very useful so that I could attend my online classes and take notes, but after the new update facing a problem in saving recorded videos and also can't find the recorded videos in Microsoft stream. Please bring that old feature of saving the recorded video permanently in stream, so that I'd acess the video whenever required."
It is good
"Please guys I know you all have did hard work and smart work to make this app ,but when ever there is a slow connection The ""Teams"" comes and says login with your password ,if that is fixed then I wouldn't have any problems ,It's apolite request please fix that issue."

Good
It's the good app for meetings
Suddenly i unconnect
"Great app but for some reason even thought the microphone on my phone or headset are functional it doesn't let me talk in conference calls, has anyone else had this problem ?"
This stupid app keeps asking me to taste it on the app store! Goodby 5 star rating
very helpful indeed but since the new update it became slow
The sound is a bit rough.
Great app but sometimes I don't get notifications for messages which leaves people waiting for a response.
Bad
"This app is OK and i repeat- OK, but i think there's a couple changes to make: first, you should be able to see more people in meetings and second you have to be able to see the people that are talking in a meeting"
"The chatroom is not user friendly. It lags during the meetings and takes so long to send messages. Sometimes, the mic also takes too long to turn on or off. Also, you can't share the screen while you are presenting a ppt. For instance if i have to elaborate something in the slides and i share screen, the presentation would automatically turn off and after done with screensharing, I have to play the presentation all over again. This wastes a lot of time and as teachers, we have very limited time."
My teams are always gone so you don't get a 5 star rating
Siempre me dice que espere y nunca carga
NiceðŸ˜„
The volume is a little too low
Good

It is very good for business purposes. But it is not suitable for school. There are lot of things to be changed and to make it simple but its feedback process is complex and hard customize. Thank you.
Pretty good but sometimes it bugs out
This app is awesome.....I love it
Had a lot of problem to login
It's not working perfectly on my phone.
It's nice
Good
"The app is good love using this. But there are few things which can improve the experience of using it. Like while sharing your screen you cannot look the chats or hand raises while presenting. Also while sharing screen after uploading files there is no option to use pointer. If these things are improved, experience will be much better."
It's good
"This is a very good app. I am a a student and thus app is one of the best for schools,but there are many problems in this app."
"There is a four problem in this app 1.When opens the chat box of the meeting , it goes from the beginning. Therr is no button like whats app to go down 2. When all the participants turn the video on its starts network issue 3. When organizer turn on the setting of the participants did not remove another participants and do not mute another participants , in this case the button of ask to join participants also removed from attende and one more problem with me but my words is unlimited"
This app is good for education but in some mobile students can not upload their ASSIGNMENT so I request you soul this problem as well as possible
App crashes

Its not bad but i dont like how its acting. Im doing virtual learning and in a teams meeting there is a chat to erite instead of talk. Well in most classes its working but i have 2 important classes that i cant chat. When i try to chst it just says post restricted where im supposed to write and btw this is not happening to every kid only some kids. Please fix this!
This app should have a nice update
This app is nice but there is problem with chat box every time it shows starting with chat and Finding the lastest massage we can scroll down again n again whenever you open the chat section this is time taken process and white board openinh time is soooo high
Boring and slow app
Not bad
Some time I can't see ppt
But the team app utilise high speed of internet and mbs it's don't work in low quality of internet
This app is very good but i am not able to do asingment please fix this problem. My exams is going to start after a week.
Because its always crashes thats why 3 star
Good app but the voice is not coming good
Goob app ðŸ‘‰ðŸ“±
It is good but some problems occur during connection. But it is excellent app
It was awesome but it takes too much network
It's good. Good for online class
Good
The app is great but please allow us to use two accounts at the same time in windows also...and the other thing is that there are two group formed in my account but sometimes it shoows only one group and it create many problems.
Nice but very glitches
"I like this app it is very nice but their are two problems 1.) Their is no ""background effect"" in mobile phone 2.) This take so much battery"
It is good but whenever there is a little network less it says no net work
It's good for office work but sometimes don't show notification due to sync between PC and computer I think.
Good
I loving this app But I already see 8 people at video call but its veey Outstanding apps Thank you Developer for the Teams App! Sometimes is the english caption is veey broken would you like to fix it please?
Glitches sometimes but other than that its good
"Wish this app has the same function as the PC version. It shares different function each other, like you cannot approve if a member has joined the group on Android version"
It glitches a lot especially when using the whiteboard.
"Works well, but I wish it would bundle notifications like other apps do. Every message is a new notification sound, even if they occur in rapid succession from the same channel. Can make my phone spend a long time just chaining notification chimes together. Other chat apps don't do this."
Very cumbersome. Phone system has glitches.
Good
Need improvement
"App is slow, notifications is not always getting through. + for supporting multiple users."
Everything is going well. But cannot open an assignment in mobile. Plz solve this issue to make me give 5 stars
"It is too good application when you use it is helpful for students, teachers and also other peoples thank you"
ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜¶
Nice
Sometimes there is a glitch so I gave three stars
Nice app
I have give three stars because first when I download this app it take a lot of time to sign in second the problem of voice and last is when I call someone I can't hear voice of anyone
I have given three because there must be a feature ie. you should add background effects for mobile also. Background effects are only for computer and laptop. You should add I mobile too. Please.
Good but not best because we are not able to remove profile image
Average ðŸ™‚
Still fairly average
Definitely a great app for videocalling and school stuff but sometimes it does lack a little polish
Keeps us updated.
Not the best
it is great for meetings but some of the things are only on laptop like changing background together mode I wish Bill Gates the founder of microsoft will see this and will implement the things from the laptop to also the mobile devices
No assignment record and calendar record on this application
Good app ðŸ‘ but after updating this app is not working proper as befor
Don't Know why it crashes many times. Features should be improved.
It is good and suitable to continue the study specially in covid-19. I like that app thanks ms team
Nice
Jitanshu
This app is very good ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ but some times the assignment section not working
I think it is lovely ðŸ’— and I think that other people should have it ðŸ˜Š
Nice but in meetings the photos were not clear
You guys need to make everyone presenter no one should be attendees We should be able to call one another
"the in-app viewer of word documents is very lacking and the quality of video meetings is quite horrible, the layout is confusing and buggy, and the video lags and freezes, specially when a participant shared their screen"
"It was good, but somehow every time I join a meeting on the right time, it won't show other people in the meeting. Is there something wrong with it?"
Slow and have real troubles in uploading Through Phone
I would like to have one upgrade in this app PLEASE UPDATE A FEATURE OF FAST FORWARDING THE RECORDING like Youtube videos SO THAT I CAN GO THROUGH WHAT I SEARCHED FOR IN THE RECORDING.
"Previously i could see the recording of our online classes later on through my android mobile , but nowadays i cannot see recordings from mobile.Otherwise it is a good app. I will be happy if u see towards the problem i am facing regarding to recordings. I look forward for ur response."
Good
There are very less keyboard shortcuts
I am not able to see phonebook option in Calls.
I have school on the teams app
it's good but sometimes i have to face problem during my classes and say to login again & again
As usual pathetic UX from microsoft
It's not user-friendly. It might be having many integrations but looking problematic to use smoothly. May be this is only for very qualified people.
Very good
Thanks ms teamðŸ”¥
Nice app to attend online class. Earlier it was the best app to attend online class far better than zoom but now after the recent updates the app has lots of glitches the video quality becomes horrible all of a sudden even though my internet is fine the person becomes invisible and audio disappears .I have to rejoin the meeting everytime this happens.kindly fix this then it will be the best app again
it's good to communicate to other peeps
Messages will not be sent unless I switch my connection. If my mobile connected to any wifi Mobile network messages will not send I have to switch to another connection no matter what connection just by switching then messages will sent. this big problem for me as I am using MS Teams very frequent in daily basis.
App is good but we can't upload background in Mobile phone's please look at that problem
Too complicated
Good app but giving less stars cause my school teaches on this app
Plz enable bluetooth headset connectivity update for Poco F1. Surprisingly it's not available in current version.
In Microsoft team all student have write to remove all student and mute all this problem is very worst please fix this bug as soon as possible ...
It is good but when im on mobile the mic makes a sound and the camera quality is bad can it be fix please? Thanks
Serves the purpose of attending meetings
It's okay
Very poor this is aap
Hangs a lot
App is good but it's not having a high sound level.
Good
It's great
Its a big problem of changing name
Super app
Vedio quality is not good
Nice
Slow and as a teacher needs improvements for easier usage
"Some utilities have limitations such as image forwarding, not answering questions of a person on the computer browser"
This app is so usefull from me because l can talk to my friend chat to my friends in group also many more ect............................................
The loading period is really bad for assignments and many more problems. But it has quite helped us in the pandemic situations for edu purposes.
ðŸ‘nice app for sharing screen â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºðŸ˜†
There have been a bunch of improvements to Teams chat that make it better than it previously was. It's still lacking on some features and the interface is still a bit cluttered. Keep the improvements coming!
It has gliches
Good
Good
Improve the user interface.
This app is good but it have certain problem that is it take take time to connect if we disconnected and it show half and time many things which got disturb in app although I gave him only 3 stars.â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
So so
"Bad experience!! We was keeping interupting each other and couldn't hear voice properly. I suggest you add Gujarati,hindi captions also in Microsoft Team app!! Please Make recording feature available for all the participants so that online learning can be easy!!ðŸ“˜ðŸ“˜ðŸ“˜ Yours well wisher!!"
"For recorded meeting, we have to download the meeting. Change this to watch online. It will be better Hope you noticed this message"
Too slow
Good
My phone is Samsung M31 and it was previously working well. But I have tried re-installing it and unable to do so.
it is so heavy app
During Meeting chat is disabled.. Fix this bug
It's a good app but there are few problems while meeting the major is that box where you can see who is speaking it's size is bit big so whatever written behind it is hard to see........ but other features are bit good so gave 3 stars
I am learning to use it. I think it is good.
There should be custom background for android
Some problem in this app
"It's good but still I can't see the chat box when my teacher says something. There are many bugs, too. Pls, fix them."
It is good but can you find out a way through which organizer can know that from what time the attendees and presenters are in the meeting because some of them left the meeting in between and enters at last minute so that they can tell that they are in meeting
"It's overall a great apl but when i on captions it doesn't show them and when i want to put a profile pic it doesn't let me. edit: This app is getting swful and awful evert day ,today i fail my test, why? Because of this app i was speaking with mic on and video on but my teacher couldn't get my voice. I want to uninstall this app but i couldn't beacuse this app is used for my online classes. I hate this app. If u can solve this, pls solve."
Teachers come to know that we arr using mobile phone
Why the chat option is removed Pls work on it
This app is good for meetings but when every have the uptade I don't i have dont every but can not
"I am using this app for quite long. It was very nice and convenient. Everything was good. But since a week or too I am facing one issue with the app, there is a bug in the app, about every 2nd day when I open the app it shows me the login page and after a number of times when I shut down the app and open again it automatically restores my account. The team need to fix this bug in Teams."
ðŸ˜­Updates are causing problems....ðŸ˜­
Nice app
Doesn't make sense it can't easily sync with google.calender. Notifications take a long time to be removed and chats are slow.
"Nearly impossible to add contacts external to your organization using an email address. It's just awful how difficult the process is. If we are both live on Teams, it shouldn't require sending an email."
Would give a 5 star but functionality of calling feature doesnt always work
"Most of time, the app automatically logged out from my account. It's kind of annoying logging in again and again."
"Decent and works okay but catch g up on regular features. Multiple accounts is a serious pain. Nobody thought that we may work at a company (possibly more) and have a home account too... Also when setting up a call/meeting there is no call-in number real pain if voip or internet connection is bad. Everybody else has this... WebEx, Zoom.... Etc... Otherwise good."
"Dear Team, I can find recorded meetings on my mobile phone but when I use my PC, the videos can be seen and available for download. Can we solve this issue already? NB: my Teams mobile app is up-to-date"
This app is good at some time but some times it gets hanged and it doesn't work
Always get kicked out or camera quits
Your profile picture is blurry when you post it but when on desktop it's clear everything Is fine tho except no background changes
There is no option to delete outdated messages sent by other people. Chats are cluttered with messages that are no longer needed.
Good
Ok good app But I use it on pc with webcam The blur background option doesn't come And atleast pls put a update for Teams virtual background in school or office meeting
"it consumes less mobile data than other meeting applications. however, you can only see 8 attendees, and the rest you cant. suggestion: swipe features where you can see the other attendees no matter how many people are there."
"Can't resize video, also if network is slow then only audio option should be there"
"Good, but sometimes it does not work"
Very nice app â™¥ï¸ I like it
I don't like the fact that I need a whole different app just so I can open up an assignment
A very heavy app
All good but missing screen access in Ubuntu .. issue with voice sometimes
Can't see the calender in it because of some missing subscription and can't cancel scheduled meetings. Platform is buggy. UX is not so good.
Good app!
The app nice but sometimes it is even unistalling
This app is better but it is should be more improvement
Good app...
Need to be able to print chats.
I've tried it on my laptop fr school but it lags so much I can't help it. I have heard this same complaint by all my classmates. Pls try to remove this lag everyone is requesting this so I took the initiative of writing this in the review column
"Not equal for students... During this pandemic and now the homeschooling this is how our children are forced to communicate through this app also learn, yet if you dont have a windows 10 device your child can't use any special features. I paid a lot of money for a chromebook, and it doesn't work the same. I also don't like that everyone is able to see in my home or i have to back my daughter up against the wall for privacy.. Please try to fix this.."
The mobile version is ugly but other than that...cool
Lagenge problem
"I like that is has support for multiple accounts, which the Windows app doesn't. Notifications doesn't always work."
Has a lot of sync issues.
Fine on its own but not productive without integration with Outlook Mobile
Good app
It has a problem where uploading things in the class notebook won't be seen in the desktop app
The latest update made things worse.
Good
Good
"Hi Team, I am getting an problem while logging to my account I am choosing work and each time getting http 400: request header is too long. That's bizzare.. I used able to take calls from my phone and now I am not! It's very critical for me to have working teams in my phone.. Can you please quickly check and get back!! Regards Arit Chakraborty"
nice
It is creation of sir Bill Gates. But few features are not given.
I found it to be helping in good interaction with teachers but it has to improve the quality of the video and the screen shared by teachers and some network issues are also there even if having a good network connection.... Other than this there is no issue regarding anything
All is okay. Thanks.
"Our school has our regular online classes on this platform. However, due to the pressure and engrossment we tend to forget when a meeting is supposed to end until someone realises it and is bound to interrupt. There, should be a feature that allows us to set up a reminder for when the meeting should end and allow us to wrap up. This feature can prove very useful as most schools have continuous classes and if there's no break between them it can prove detrimental to focus and learning."
Sorry we cannot take you destination this time. This error shown while opening assignment.
There must be some ai used for reducing background noise during audio chat
"This is app is very nice for studies during novel,coronavirus very good app"
"Good application, BUT it takes a lot of CPU (my phone is VEEEEERY HOT after 15 minutes of meeting). Please improve the performance issues! Thank you."
I like this app but it doesn't have as many features as IOS or computer
It's consume a high data and some time file can't upload in ms team
Nice app
Good app for meeting
Better if the app supports split screen
This app is good but whenever i unmute myself my clqss teacher can 't heary voice or the chat option is also gone sometimes and when i switch on my camera my teacher can't see me and this problem is worst my teacher markes me absent ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ . Plz fix this problem
Average
good but not as convenient as slack. integration of different ms features is great
Good
"Es muy Ãºtil. La mejor parte es el apartado de tareas. Sin embargo, el calendario es poco eficiente, reemplaza actividades sin notificar y con frecuencia desaparecen los links de las reuniones que se programan con anticipaciÃ³n."

Not bad it is good.
Normal app
This app is amazing helps me everyday but the data usage is a lot. Mobile storage taken is also not according to the service it provides. Only 8 people are visible at a time. This app is better on a computer or laptop but on mobile phone it calls for a lot of trouble. That is why just rating it a 3 star. Please improve
"I decresed rating 3 from 4, because i posted "" I can't downlode files from the app. It shows downloding files but never finish. Please fix the problem "" after 2 and half month problem remains as same"
The chat box is not there for many people
Fine not bad
Not fully good
Nice app
My experience in teams is nice but sometimes it doesn't work properly
it is good
Well but not so good
It's good but the thing I hate the thing is we can't delete chats in it..!!ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
Needs to have notification settings like be able to turn off sound for calls etc..
Very slow to launch and refresh new messages.. Compared to whatsapp its bit laggy to chat which is the primary functionality of the app... Agree it has lot more features to offer but should not compromise on performance
It's good
Sometimes children find difficult to use it.app not responding sometimes.assignments not able to receive at sometimes.need some improvement.not user friendly.
Nice app but now I can only see faces on meeting but I can't hear a word...
It just deserves 3 stars...It needs to better
"There are hackers in our online classes named JETHALAL GADA, TAPU KE PAPA, SALMAN KHAN who are removing the students from the class, please do something about this"
It's a better in virus time and it is google line in virtual classes
The app is good the new update makes it more nice but I give 3 stars because 1. It lags to much 2. It takes too much mb
Good app
I am a student and i think the app is not so good for studying....I have to watch the recordings but I cannot watch unless I download the video itself... the recording doesn't go to stream and If I start downloading the recording it doesn't shows how much I have downloaded and how much is left to be done and if I suddenly close the app or my connection worsen then the download stops and I have to start all over again.
Very bad

This is good app
Not bad
Nice but try to improve more
This a amazing app
"Hi! I have a problem with this app because we use it for webinar in our school class. All students in webinar can remove someone. And I am removing but I only saw is ""Someone removes you"". Can you please state the name who removes me? Or can you please able that the only creator can remove someone? This app is very useful than zoom but the only problem is everyone can remove someone while video call is on going."
Sometimes it doesn't connect and show the meeting hasn't started yet .. otherwise its awesome
ðŸ‘
Very fine app
Its a good app which consumes less data but still it has some loop holrs #1 unable to download the files sent by the ownet #2 i was even not getting the posts or updates sent by the owners #3 video gets automatically blur sometimes Leaving these issues its a great appâœ“âœ“âœ“
"Â¡Pongan otra vez las grabaciones! O para descargarlas asÃ­ como se hace en computadora por lo menos... Por lo contrario, todo bien..."
My job they use this what a delight!
"This is great and very useful when it works. However, when I change my password, I am no longer able to log in."
I can't download the app.
Not good not bad voice break video not show
It gets pretty laggy a lot of times.
It gives the children online work. And during lockdown I've been using this! Enjoy!
It crashes sometimes
Good for scool
It's good but I need to sign up with my glow account for school so I could chat.
This app is best for online classss
Nice microsoft
Amazing and best version
Connection issues before every login
Worst
Good
Calls get cut off. Should have some added features. Good connectivity.
"Still now good but can be better. I would love the stability and not the occasional lag ,for which I have to disconnect the ongoing class and join again, almost in every class."
"Works OK i guess, just a bog standard comms app."
I kicks me out I don't when why
"It's great when it works. There are too many factors that affect voice and video calling, making it next to impossible to know when and if the issue is with Teams, something else, or a combination of both."
"Good video and audio collab app...Had to wait for ChromeOS to roll out a volume slider to enable the use in Teams to switch from webcam mic (which was sub-par) to my audio jac/headphone, as there is no audio/video settings toggle yet for Teams Android...maybe they're still sore about the Windows phone. Regardless, waiting for all the bells and whistles to hit Android version, maybe incl the background blur...."
Cool but sometimes fluctuates intermittently
Teams has come along very quickly but still a bit buggy on the mobile side. Works perfectly on the computer
"Started off well in the bigging of our countries lockdown due to corona virus, obviously no one was using it much before then... as more people migrated to skype/team, 3 months later it freezes during meetings, sometimes doesn't even show screen presentations ðŸ¤¨.... either than that I like itðŸ˜"
Not optimised for mobile devices The chat box isn't visible while video is on Bad mobile interface
Assigment page didnot show any thing .other all pages work proper but assigment doesnot open. My teachers send me work but i cannot saw them. Please solve this
Nice
EstÃ¡n bien las clases pero para enviar o entrar a la tarea desde un telfefo es muy complicado
all my friends got school computers i have my own and its a chrome book os and well they can change there backgrounds but i can't
Good to the teams need a lot of improvement
Awesome
Nice app
It's Good app
I'm not a fan that you can't change your background in the mobile version...this forces people to buy webcams and there's only s small list of expensive cams that are compatible...
The app is good ðŸ‘
When I try to login they say there was a problem with the network try again later but my network is very well please give me the solution
Microsoft. Teams
"I have given three star because updates that are there in pc not available in this mobile app. This is of Microsoft company and I thought that they can do more than this, so please update it and bring all the updates available in pc. I also request to make one of the most important update of sharing audio also when sharing with phone. But I want to also say that it is good application mainly in these type of situation COVID-19. I hope they will do all these update. ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™"
Sometimes it comes like the app is not responding so it might create a problem but otherwise his app is very good
BetterðŸ‘
Ù„Ø§
While doing wfh my teammates hear family members voice eventhough we joined through head set....is it possible to avoid this??
The app is a bit slow but everything else is good
It's a very good app
Good app
Because it required too much high quality internet speed and daily data pack finish in 1-2 meattings
"An update needs to be made on the meeting lobby, to ensure its only the organiser of the meeting have the authority to grant people access to join the meeting (for those outside your organisation)"
It's a good way to teach on-line classes. Thank you!
"Good app but way too many bugs and glitches, video call quality is OK, cant manage your account if you are under a institution , it would be good to able to manage some of the account, CONFUSING, I have to litrellaly see the tutorial video to understand the app. Voice and video dosent reach other side and i use team as a student and these two thing are really important for me plz fix these problem"
"Great and feel relaxed ,only I want to know how to show videos please explain"
Excellent
Good
It is good but crash intermittently when i am on teams call pls check and correct this crash issue
I need to join class i measta i uninstalled it and i install this it came fast
"Good app, but needs lots of improvements"
Why i dont have a background
Please give the authority to the host.. or the organiser who is conducting the teams meeting.
There is no option of delete plzz develop this system
Nice app
"Best app, but when some one share the screen two boxes are apper at bottom and it makes difficulty to see the screen .Please improve this as soon as possible"
Frequently freezes up my pc
very nice interface. But few things to improve like group call We could see only 6 to 8 DP can do some more improvements.
What we should do if app is showing administrator has disable the chat option
"""it's very nice"" But audio quality problem"
"I like this app but, there is no option to delete message in general channel by attendees, so make that Feature.... Please"
9x . I job 8
The new update is not that good. Cause usually when I started the meeting I was always muted but now I'm always unmuted in the meeting. Please do something
"been using this app for at least 3 weeks for online classes. it was fine at first but starting yesterday, the app kept crashing. in the middle of a meeting it would drop the call and exit the app even if the data connection was fine and it would work perfectly well on a laptop. also happened that now i can't open the app because it keeps exiting. im unistalling and reinstalling to try it again. it would be very unfortunate if this keeps happening since this is our main portal fot online classes."
Needs lots a data and hangs little during meeting but a good app
"People who have difficulties using it after update, uninstall the app and install it again, it worked for me! :)"
Issue with recording
It's very good app for online classes but it's new version in hanging to much while studying.
Nice app
Requires high speed internet and storage
"When I join meetings, Bluetooth connections are not available."
"Is there any option to log out? It's a workplace equipment. I don't want to work after my paid hours. That's redick. **edit** Sign Out option is under the ""settings"" (do not even search for it in the status menu)"
It slows down other applications on my laptop
Please create an option for delete messages please
NYC Ap for group study
Nice App... !! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
One thing beats me - teams mobile app has a 'reply' feature while the PC version of the app does not! Guess it's a very complicated feature to implement in an electron pc application.
So I personally don't like school it is a nice app if u like school if I liked school I would give this app a 5 out of 5 but is a good app to teach on if u r a teacher
Net probelam vice probelam
This app works well but one feature of this app is very poor that any participant can remove other participants
Super
Bluetooth option not working
Nice app but if network is slow it goes on searching for network...
Its ok
It is a very nice app
Add more features
Ok
Ok
Nice app but the organiser is just a damn
Nice but always lacks and some time we can't join
Hi I liked this app but the problem which I am facing is that whenever the host shares a presentation my team app stops responding. I hope microsoft will resolve my problem. I will give this app five stars if my problem is resolved.
Best App
the volume is too low. unable to here voice without earphones.
Sometimes it takes time in opening some options like assignment option.
Eh
Recently I am unable to use my Samsung galaxy buds on teams app. There is no sound nor to the microphone working.....using it on Samsung galaxy S20+...... any help?
"Its a good app for learning but one problem is that my school computer died so I git this app and I needed to create a new document, I got the link but when I tried to paste the link on here It didn't allow the clipboard (what the phone uses to paste) so I had to email my teacher the document If you fix that then I would give this 5 stars."
It's an heavy app!
I used to have the option of background effects and now is gone again please give me those things back and I will be happy as I was with those stuff before. Thanks
Easy to use. Very user-friendly. The audio and visual is spotty at times and it would be great if a breakout room feature could be developed.
Good
"Changing orgs is an issue. MS assumes that people are working for the same org. So, I can either log into my parent org or my Clients' org but not both. For someone like me who has multiple Clients expecting me to be on their Teams app, this is an issue. Other than that, the app is basic and works."
I found very much login problemzðŸ™„
"For text messaging this app is okay, for video is kind of slow, for meme and emoji they are hard to use."
Could not get into the class. Wondering if the teacher can see that I am waiting in the lobby.
I lost all my contacts and o can't use the background feature and also it keeps saying administrator has disabled chat
Presently recorded videos are not being saved Pls fix this
Video quality is not that gd
Whenever i try to upload my work from the option upload from device it just completely hangs and a black screen appears on my phone i have to restart my phone and uninstalling didnt work either plz fix
WHERE IS THE CHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ARGHHHH!!!! Edit 1: PLS ANSWER!!!!!!!
Because
Very stuck
"Logging in led me into a labyrinth of problems until I finally found a diversion..... It's just like Google classroom but much better. Google classroom is a nightmare to get to and now using this app gave me the chance to start with my college. I do recommend, but don't make mistakes during logging in. It's like a never ending maze of stress when that happens."
5bh.
Everything you do your teacher sees came on but it's a good app for online classes
All tools in the same place. No need to play with different softwares at the same time. It could be great to have more connectivity with other apps.
I liked it but this app was hanging again and again
It's consuming more Data. Try to give a update for low data consumption as Google Meets is consuming less than Teams while 2 hrs online meetings.
App is useful but i know how to use this app lately
Good but i am not able to see blur and background option
"This app was very nice, that way I gave 3â­â­â­ stars, but it not working properly this app was after some days always going to teams sign in again sign in again , ahhhha that's why only I gave 3 â­ stars please check properly ok na"
Doesnt work well with video for 4plus people
It consumes lots of data
Some laptop camera doesn't work out. Integrated camera doesn't supported error message received but the camera works in other apps.
ðŸ¤’ðŸ¤’
An Excellent Collaboration Application
Good
App features are good. But the app asks for login and initial setup everytime I open the app. That's really irritating.
It gives so many problems to students at the time of login........ Security verification etc
Nicely
this is very nice but somtimes i can get a little annoyed but its very nice
At times... The meeting would have started...but we wouldn't be able to join it..
The audio and video is good but microsoft teams consums too much data so i suggest that to solve this problem and also consums too much battery of mobile phone

Good
"Good app but starts to hang after some weeks . Teams get vanished (I am using it for school and so english , science etc. Teams) . So please fix this issue ."
It's good for studies
Gud to meet online
Gud
It was great but at times we faced some small issues with the camera and microphone
It is not a good app it has many glitch like I have joined a meeting someone removed me from the meeting please fix the problem
Where is the recorded videos goes I can't found it in my phone when meeting ends
When it works it's gold but some policies are stupid !
Good

Not bad
"Actually it is good as compared to other video apps but now I am facing some issues, I am not able to see recorded video and the recorded video are not so clear. But while considering other features it is really a good software for students , teacher's and also for others"
It's not running properly showinh some error or issues
Nice app but many times it slow....
Much much better than skype.but why you don't have option to turn off vibration notification on android phone. It's eats up phone battery every 500 times when chats coming in. Reduced stars from 5 to 3
The ms teams app is good but from few days it is facing some much of network issues
This is a useless app ðŸ˜¡ whenever I open it it starts showing rubbish
I experience lots of disturbance due to network issue
this app is useful for online classes.
Please provide us an option to set the quality of meeting video to lower resolution because takes a lot of data.
Good but not best Or worst
Good.
Its good bt it takes too much utilization of net.... Almost full data is being used by teams apps...
Overall good..but the problem is with user interface..as my opinion ui is not so friendly ... please improve this ...
It is very nice. but when I speak in meeting my sound gets vibrate and I can't speak anything so please make it better and if you solve my query than I will change the ratings..
It is very helpful for studies but there is some bugs in it .....In chat iam a member but i cant leave or chat and same Problem for others kindly fix it.....Polly and some tools are very useful...Then in meeting notes something is trouble it should be fixed eventhough it is my favourite meeting app Again most bugs i cant mute even though in full network area ...this happens sometimes but during class disturbs other
Good
Natural voice problem
There is a small problem to connect bluetooth headset.
Storehouse of bugs
It ok
Better
Need some bug fixes
It's good just the problem is...that it loses network again and again even if a good network is available...and not showing assignment notifications sometimes.
This app is good and helps in attempting classes. But this app uses much data and also uses up very fast so I have given it 3 stars and its latest update is not much good but if we see this app is very helpful .There is no trouble in connecting.
Yes it is good app ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•
"I dont how to how sign up, help meðŸ¤— those may school mates are already sign in, it is very useful i knewðŸ™‚"
"This app is nice but whenever I switch on my video it takes me out from the meeting and saying there's a glitch and we are trying to recover it , So please pay attention at this problem please ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
The app doesn't have raise hand icon on some android phones
Gud
Very good
I like this app but i dont know why cant i use the private chat option
"Do not disturb still shows me chat notifications, its really stressful"
Is god but sometimes is confusing
Good ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜š
my question Y dis app error a lot
Message copy/paste and deleting options to be included.
When sharing screen the Ms Teams is not responding and stay in a black screen.
Note 20 ultra can not use Bluetooth headset audio for calls and meetings
Well it is annoying that ii doesn't refresh/update whenever you get pm's not even when using wireless
"I used it for school during lockdown because it was really useful and everything was digital but we're out of lockdown now and my school has stuck to teams and handing in work is annoying because the teachers will ask you why did you hand in the work on teams but we hand it in physically TL;Dr used it for school, school bad"
There is a problem when someone is present his computer screen then I watch these meeting in mobile then if that person share his screen then sometimes his screen is not viable . Why the recorded video is not available for mobile.
Very difficult to switch between work account and school account but generally very good otherwise
"The ui that allows us to talk or cancel my call etc.. does not appear when you on it tap or even click. It. Please fix it,it is frustrating when it doesn't respond on time"
This app is amazing! It helps when I have to do online school. But it is REALLY glitchy for a lot of people.
Sometimes am not heard well and visuals blurred
The conntection os not working well
Good
"Meetings signal could be better, Google meet looks more reliable."
I love this because as you no in under covid 19 all children don't go to school this will help them and recover their syllabus
Not that bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤£
Need more work the connections arnt the best
Forced me to rate it.
Nice app for my online school
"It is good application but there is a big pug, I can't get incoming calls on my phone. Also some meetings become Heiden on the phone but it is normal on the PC"
Nice App
Uses too much internet
Good
All parties should be notified automatically when a recording is being made. A major infringement of privacy. Issue needs to be addressed immediately.
"Feature wise its Good, but its slow"
Mm good
"This app is useful but it is very heavy app , other wise it is the best app for chatting , video calling , classes assignments ,etc.It takes lots of storage .And when I installed it in my laptop the app was not working properly."
Landscape mode should be available which sharing the screen. It is very difficult to see the text and object in portrait mode when the screen of laptopðŸ’» is shared in meeting.
This app is good for online classes and meetings
Average
When there is alot of people on a meeting the connection is bad
Because of covid 19 our school is doing online classes in this app only. But the problem is it takes lot of net and battery too. So i have given three stars otherwise it is good. Stay home Stay safe ðŸ˜· ðŸ˜·
Everything is nice but we need to download the recording that's why gave 3 stars
Best I like this app but this app said call ended
Let the chat box start with the recent msgs
Nice app for online classes
Effective for school work
It has has not be linking meetings
"This app lags alot but it's good. I think the video and audio quality should be better. I can't unmute or turn my camera on and my laptop is lagging because of this app. Please fix it, other than that it's good."
So bad because full network problems
Nice app but needs inprovement
It's doesn't allow to talk or chat privately..
The app is commendable.. We can record calls Presenting screen and video are appreciable Assignments etc. all features are very nice But it should have pages like zoom where we can see a lot of people on different pages not just 8 in one page And we should come to know who removed us from the meeting.... Infact the app crashed several times demanding password n some credentials million times
Good app
I cannot see shared screens when using my phone. Makes academia difficult
Sana next update kita na lahat may meeting call
"The Desktop Application update has made very limits please make it back the download options for recorded videos is removed for all only owner can download that's bad, for downloding everyone should have access And please make one more permission such as if anyone schedule the meeting sometimes their may be net issue so he can give access as oragnizer to any other members of that group so that any changes needed can be done and he can also download."
I would like the 2 stars because this app do not give me the background change
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Nice app for my school live classes ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ
Good app
It lags alot
"It is better than google meet , a lots of people can join together, we can chating and study on this app"
Best app for online class But the problem is that when the mobile has net then to this app detech slow network
I like this app but the picture of mine and the presenter in the bottom right corner annoys me very much. Give an option to hide them. I could not see the bottom right portion of the presentation. Please do it as soon.
"I like this app but i am a small boy, and lockdown is there and this time i only want to online game but i have to study 2 hours that why i give this app 3 star but this app is very nice you can do work with app,you are going offices and you do meeting, but now you can use this app to do your meeting"
Kachu bachu app
Great!!!
Needs improvement in UI. Accessibility is slow
I am not able to see recorded videos in the app
Best app for virtual classes but some times Im not able to hear ma'am voice so if you improve this then this would best virtual classes app
It's great but not for the students......hehe
"I like this app, but when admistor are send password then we change the the security password the message of the releted to we entered password is showing below the current password,please update this thing becoz. when i enter password i give the message from the password i entered but i think that the admistor password is wrong."
It takes very much time to install though the speed of the internet is 16 mbps and just for that today I missed my one important class
It's very nice but a lot of network connection error
App works fine but why we have to scroll down to bottom to see new messages from the start of the first meeting in Android. It's damn irritating
This is app is very slow app and i hate this app
Its stopping again and again.
It is good
Ok
Good but some improvement neded
Itas a good app but lots of technical difficulties
Decent
App's great for collaborating with large number of participants in real time. But it has started showing a few quite irritating complications.
total glicthes in i pad please sought out the problem
Just good
I can't sign in?
WHY CAN'T I USE TWO ACCOUNTS ON ONE DEVICE!!!!
"It always delay to open and takes like forever to do things like watch recorded meeting and open files and open app and remove someone from a group chat and also when there is a meeting there are 27 people but I can only see 4, me as a student I say it's not helpful because then I miss classes so Microsoft cooperation do something don't mean to be rudeðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜¦but I really wanted to give u guys 2 ðŸ”¯star but I decided to give 3 because apart from THIS ERRORS Its a really great app RSVP THANKSðŸ˜šðŸ˜—ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜˜"
After downloading the app there is no Team Folder. I tried on two different phones but still same problem
It really nice
"I don't like the fact that the app will freeze or drop from time to time, but the pros outweigh the cons... I like the fact that we can all communicate through this app.. it keeps us notified of everyone's task.. (provided that the personnel uses this app.)."
"sometimes does not update, but who needs the most recent messages?"
"It's a good app to communicate with your students and make sure they've done their work, I gave it 3 stars because I'm a student and this app smells like idiot but it's great and useful so 3 stars it is : )"
Sometimes it just won't open.
"There is a problem with this version, the app restarts out of nowhere and without being in the background"
Actually the new version has a lot of problems!!Especially with the recording which hv to be separately downloaded which is a huge troublemaker n this recording r not saved in microsoft stream.... Also this recordings hv started getting expiry date (20 days ).....So plz work on it n make it as it was before without all the problems that are mentioned above
Apps notification is not coming up properly on android 9
It is so edible app so i gave 3 ðŸŒŸ ok thank you nice to meet you
In this app my persnol chat is disabled I think that the teams is giving issue so please fix it as soon as possible I have to attend lectures.ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
The app is very good but i gave three stars only because in the first there use to be chatting option but after update it os not there so plz keep that chatting option that is the only problem..or else it is very super app.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
It's nice app but the only problem I found is it's goes to offline status very quickly if we aren't using it
Disturbing app
This app was really good. After update it is not working properly. The recorded videos should be downloaded. Please make the changes the last version was good.
"Good, but regularly asks me to sign in again. Annoying."
I haven't option of change background
Good
Everything is fine..except video..when we start video calling..we only can see 4 to 5 peoples's video..this needs to be impliminted
Good
Good
Interesting app for students and workers. A pretty confuse in the beginning.
Very smooth and easy to use
Great access to Teams while away from my desk.
Good app
It is good but we can't record
Very nice app
Nice one
I like it although the notifications are somewhat inconsistent. I sometimes find that someone has posted or sent something hours or days later. Update: it's official. There are many improvements and I'm now a huge fan of Teams as a collaboration tool. Each update has improved functionality.
"This app is so useful cauze you can chat,you can do videocall and calls and i am a 6th class student i chat with my friends,with my teacher for clear my doubts ðŸ˜Š"
great
"So far, so good. New user. I like what I see."
I liki it
Still learning it and getting used to it.
Very Guud
Excellent app so far.
Excellent technology
My teacher told me to download this so I can get notifications on my phone when he sends the class new homework and stuff. I find it helpful cause I can double check and not need to get my laptop out on the bus or smth. It's also good for when he assigns homework after school hours so I can see what's due when and yea... Makes things easier to have it on my phone too
"It's good, but there are old messages that I would like to scroll to find, but need a search field for key words. The chat is loooooong, making it difficult to find some information in previous messages."
Pretty good sometimes it does not come up till after the assignment is posted but as long as you check it regularly you should be fine.
It was Great!
Perfect for communication with my team.
Nice schole appðŸ˜º
Very efficient and cost-effective tool
"I get alerted from my co-workers while on the go. I wish it was easier to set the settings of my availability from the app, but considering I'm only on it when away from the computer. It does it's job."
"Very convinient for working remotely and meeting with colleagues. Able to share screen, hold large meetings, create meetings using the calendar feature, create Team Folders that allow file sharing and tracking team members work and I'm sure a lot more that I don't know about. I haven't received training on what Teams can do, but I found it very user friendly and easy to navigate."
Pretty good so far not to bad
Too long to connect
Great app. It's been reliable for me so far. Love the design and layout. Have had audio issues once or twice. No issues recently.
Options available in the iPhone version seem to be missing in this app. No ability to change your voice mail greeting like you can on the iPhone app. Would like to see this feature. Thanks
"Great for Teams meetings away from my computer. I normally schedule my Teams meetings from my laptop but this app helps me with meetings I cannot attend from my desk or my computer. The only problem I see is that a screen shared by someone else does not rotate into the horizontal, making it harder to see the content because it will only work in the vertical."
"It's good, but I can't sign in using my academic institution e-mail address. Although I can do this online, the Teams app doesn't support using an academic e-mail address."
It's very good educational to thank you for this beautiful creation. Experience was also excellent. Something's nature related to audio need to improve. Voicegate cut in between. Sometime audio get disconnected. It's not a good it need to improve
Nice
Good So cool
This app is Educated with your teacher.
"Good Experience, But Some times Take time to open."
Its not the same as on the computer
But ido not know how to delete chats
"Pretty good, nice video call but the chat feature is kinda confusing and buggy sometimes"
"There should be an option for backup, the older messages get deleted which might contain some critical info, also one more thing is, while downloading or uploading any file, the status is not shown."
I love this app. I am facing issue in the desktop version. The full screen mode has been removed.. Please bring it back..
Good
That's all 4 stars it has some logging problem that's why lol
Stable
Good
Good but not able to quote message
Works great.... just as described
Nice
It is so good app. I love this app
Good
"User friendly, great app"
Com a adiÃ§Ã£o do p.i.p o app tÃ¡ quase perfeito. Estou tendo problemas com as atualizaÃ§Ãµes automÃ¡ticas dos grupos e do chat.
UI and desktop apps are not intuitive but gets the job done.
Good
We need to be able to schedule meetings for private channels. It's a frequently expressed need by many users.
Good
It's fine but sometimes getting hang
Ok day to day messaging For meetings not enough features. Zoom better and easier to use.
"Works for what it is meant for. It is not always consistent, but that is a sporadic issue."
"Calidad en audio y video, no me parece bien, que no muestre TODAS las tareas, hay que buscar de clase en clase"
Nice
Good app very useful the only thing I dont like is that you cannot delete the chats
Great work
"It has a few lags and sometimes doesn't respond, but it's fine...ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
"Good but seems way more basic than it needs to be, I feel it is just that way because they want people to use the windows client"
It take lot of net during photo or file in assignment
"Teams is excellent... gives an interactive vibe, whilst we work from home"
Good tool
"Easy to use, and stable, the only missing thing is to share files without the need to adhere to other services"
Me
Good
"It is very nice app, i do my online classes on this app and i want to say that this app has so many good features but some times it doesn't work,otherwise this app is great Thank you!"
"Zoom better, sorry guys"
Very good
This is a perfect and awesome

"You should have added recorded lectures of the online classes which went on that time so it could have been useful for others who didn't attend the class adu that time. That feature would be great as students wilt lag when they are on the syllabus even when they are absent for some reasons that feature is very important, soo please look to it and dont ignore as some useless description given my Indian, thanks a lot"
Screen share is not working
have not tried
Its a ok or i can say nice app ... We can do anything we want but there is a problem that sometimes it itself gets disturbed by itside .... Once when were giving halfyearly exams it produced an error from itside and none could see the haflyearly paper.... Otherwise is ok
I like it but I would like to see the status stay the same. Ex..I see green or busy on my app and my coworker will say hey I see you you're on yellow. The rest of the app features work well ðŸ‘Œ
Great
Good and easy to use
Great for work communication
Official only
Cool app
"The mobile app and desktop app work hand in hand. For full features, I prefer the desktop app. I love the fact that Teams developers take into consideration feedback from clients in updating regularly their app. Teams work wonderfully for organization needs."
"We use this app for university currently, and I find it really easy to use and think it is great! However I know some of my classmates find it hard to navigate"
Good however sound sometimes broken up.
The App is brilliant for chat. We need the same features on laptops so we can reply by referencing specific chats.
"Good ,issue is preseenting not ppt ."
very nice app. but pls add the chat option so that we can do chating
It is been good. But I miss many more features like the ones on slack. Please introduce them.
Wow
Good
Nice app
Useful tools
"Videos are not played properly, when they are shared."

Nice app easy to use.
Good interface.
Creative and Seemless App.
Very good We have a lot of options
Good but need more improvement
Good clarity in video Crystal clear sound Good options Keep it up. It make us well connected during this Pandemic times. The features are good. We could record and store it. But very rarely use it. It has become a social Guard for all of us. Good clarity in video Crystal clear sound Good options Keep it up. It make us well connected during this Pandemic times. The features are good.

Works for work.
Good for online classes..
Very nice app for metting and in lockdown for online classes and best experience
"Useful app for working from home in the current situation. For school, I have all my classes on teams and I can see my assignments easily. EDIT : I have been struggling to keep on top of my workload with teams because there is no way to see all the assignments for different groups in one place e. g. a list. It is easy for an assignment to slip under the radar because you have to go on each individual team to see what is due when. Hopefully a solution can be found."
The app doesn't work properly I always have to sign in to work on it and many of the time it shows that I am submitting incorrect password.
A good app
Please put back the Speed option again students really want to finish watching those long lectures in 1.5x or 2x Put this option plzz
Great App
Sometimes takes time ok get up to date
I rate it 4 because someone removing me again and again
It is just great app. It helps me in studying.
Hoping that there is a background change option for androids or iPhone users
There is no private chat . Please give all members a private chat no matter what
It's difficult for teachers but is good app
I can't view the background option in androids..... And it is always telling me that the meeting hasn't started yet whenever I join through the calendar
Very good app.I really like but don't know how to start or create a meet in this app.
Excellent e service
Good
not friendly user sa phone.. pero sa laptop /computer okay siya .
Good
It is helpful ðŸ˜€
I don't know why they removed the message option which was actually so helpful. But everything else seems great.
This app consumes very much internet in short time and no internet is left please solve the issue
Please allow to set a custom notification tone for incoming messages.
It was nice to use the app... It also has aGood quality of video calls ....apart from this only prblm was we are unable to use the white board of it.
This aap is good
Very good and useful for work operation... but unable to reply to a specific message like Whatsap... should have that feature
"Incredible app, and super secure! But for some reason, assignments isn't working. Please see to it. Also, I think the meeting calls need to be more sturdy against bad network."
Good app but when i need to upload pdf from an app on microdoft teams then it doesn't show that app in 'upload from device' option.

Good its not updating timely on its own
Slightly lag on pc

"Works fine, but for some stupid reason whemever i get into a call it turns my screen black and it doesnt respond to anything, and it either turns on again after a few seconds or i have to turn off and on again"
Great app for office communication ðŸ‘
Great ðŸ‘Œ
Yuvraj
"Excellent Platform for online teaching and learning specially in current scenario of COVID-19. Some features that are available in desktop version are missing in phone app e.g. Missing 'meet now' option in chats. Lastly if all students in a class be made attendees by default, it would be more useful for teachers to avoid everyone writing/erasing on the white board while the teacher is explaining. ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
Nice application
Works very smoothly and meetings too go without any disturbance
"This app is awesome.But the major drawback is that once when we are in the call,we can't hear everyone clearly.Continuous cracking of voice is a big problem.So please rectify this error."
"Good, useful"
There is a issue in assignment section whenever i open it always loading i need quick response please improve this thing
Sometimes it goes too good but now its again and again kicking me out so please manage Otherwise it's a good app
Audio should be better than this
Good.
Good
"Almost perfect. Only that, participants of a group call should not be allowed to mute or remove other participants from the stream. There should be one or a few Moderators hose to possess this ability."
Good

It is a wonderful app just the problem is while attending any meeting you cannot see all the participants at one time
Some features need to be added
Good but somtimes it is too very slow in loading
Nice App
I am having my clsses in Microsoft Teams. The classes are clearly hearable. But I'm giving only 4 stars because it needs a lot of data.

"App is really good, if someone remove you then administration should get notified"

I like it. Nice app.
Very useful for various classrooms and training sessions.
I like this app ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„a lot but why I have 4 stars because if we do screen share my phone get hangedðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ up so that only I giving 4 stars
This app is really a great one. I use it for my meetings. But I gave this app 4 stars because in some meetings I am not able to chat with other participants but they are able to chat.
Fine
Very good
Good but not that much
It's nice and easy to use
great app. so useful especially during COVID.
"God in mobile , no problem. In pc sometimes the slide gone, need to rejoin again to make it appear."
Would be cool if it had an amoled-friendly theme
It has some of the best features out there but it has a lot of bugs here and there that really pisses me off
Amazing but There is glitchs in the shared video even when my internet connection is very good I wish to update the teams with new update that included this feedback â¤ï¸
Should be more safe to avoid hackers.
"Creat app on phone, not so good on computer. Easy learning."
"Would be five if we could use the ""meet"" feature using the app, instead of only on the computer on the ""Teams"" tab."
Great on official co-ordination. All colleagues replies on time . Hehe ðŸ˜
"Easy to navigate, keeps me in touch with my team"
"The collaboration aspect is good, I struggle with Teams meet though and can only be heard speaking when I am on my phone, not my laptop"
Search option should be better.. rest of the features are best
"En verdad disfruto lo intuitiva que es con el usuario, gracias por sus serviciosðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Š"
Great yet some you tube links won't work
Very useful for school but kinda hard to understand
"Thus is an excellent app, the cours online are more efficient than the cours presentiel. There is the possibility to record the cours. But there is a problem that sometimes the video that is recorded, fixes on one slide but you can hear the audio, but you wont see what he is talking about in the next slides."
Great for work.
"Using daily at our work for the past year. Call quality, both audio and video, is good, decent set of options. Like any software there's a learning curve but this wasn't too bad to learn and for us the integration with Outlook, OneDrive, Office, etc works well."
How to change the name profile
I love Teams.
This app did ruine my holidays thouuu
Good
"This app works pretty good, except for the fact that when your internet drops, it becomes very glitchy, otherwise, this app is great"
"Fantastic application, but disturbs sometime"
"Great collaboration, syncs well with the desktop app, be prepared though, you will always be contactable"
i laerend a lot from teams i love Microsoft teams its a great app
Well
Use it every work day and if you work remotely in microsoft office it has become the primary communication tool. Downside is you end up spending too much time in meeting.
nice
For me very confusing but makes it possible it communicate
Legit experience.
It is a good app but sometime it has glitches
It hangs sometime
Very good
"Grin and bear it, there is gold at the end of this rainbow"
"It is good in general,but there no private meeting recording option which is very very crucial when u r in school and especially when u have boards,in study apps like toppr,vedantu,byju and all u can watch the vdos anytime and everytime, i wanted it to be like that."
No sound issues! ðŸ™„
It's very useful.
Nice but little defoults
Very good
Useful and Convenient
can have proper online conversation
Very intuitive and easy to use.
Get tool for staying connected. I work in a lot of places where i have qifo but no phone and this works great.
Excellent apps I never see easer like that.
Aveces hay problemas
User friendly
Best app for education purpose meeting but one suggestion please show percentage of attended meeting in profile section.
Excellent
Over all its pretty good..havent used it much
hard
Good experience overall but it should provide more options for use in mobile phone
It slows down my computer lots even when I have an XPS13
I can't record the video
Very good . But now able to add more that one account. That is the only problem. Otherwise it is a very good app.
"Good version of teams, but it would be nice if it had integrated Office viewers like the desktop version"
Good
"Turn off notifications and this is an excellent app. Works so well and is presented much better than other live meeting apps. Does crash if too many people talk at same time so it is important to tunr off notifications. Also sometimes when someone is screensharing you can't see it immediately, you will need to click out of the meeting then click back in. Like go into chat then go in again."
Good app
"The app is really nice, like any other app. But the video calling is really a pain at times. Lag, slow connectin, freezing."
Good app
Its nice and stuff but when I login through my laptop it tells ''we couldn't sign in'' and when I log out I cant login again please fix this issue.
Had a few issues with messages not appearing causing me to reopen the app. But other then that this app is great.
Good
amazing app.
"It's good but everytime I go into it, I have to re-enter my password, this is kind of annoying but other than that this app is pretty great for my school work. Thank you. :)"
"Good app but this app is updated . I didn't like the option of that we can see 8 members at a same time , the four member one of good one"
The app is amazing and works to my satisfaction. Would totally reccomendations it
Its great app for meeting
Convenient app. Mobility enhancing.ðŸ‘
it good
Super app
Good
"Its awesome we can so many things in it its a amazing app this is the best microsoft video conference ever i seen. So i gave 4 stars because i am doing online class in it but, sometimes thier is a option of assignment it dosent open for some children in our school, and if thier is a exam the half questionition will not be visible at all. please do ssomething for this problem. So for this reason i gave 4 stars ratings."
Great and helpful app
"Please improve video , screen sharing ,etc"
Does the job! Feels heavy though
Great app.needs to integrate with the Google driving features so I can go mute/see status of a call while driving (hands free)
"The app is awesome! It has all the features needed.. It is not like Zoom where you can't add files. Awesome for schools.. But, sometimes it just gets laggy..Please fix that"
Good but sometimes connexions are not clear
Good
Mice app
Great app
Gud one..
Easy to use and very effective.
some time slow and taking space in memory
Excellent to communicate with your teachers during quarintine
The app is totally amazing and this is a very useful app for students also but there is one thing that I don't like much on this app is that the background is in a dark shade and that is what should be removable.
Good so far
Hi. This is app is perfect!! I gave 4 stars because i would like you to add a meeting log to see who kicked/muted who. This feature would be great for meeting organizers and if you manage to do it. I'll put 5 stars ðŸ˜Š
ðŸ‘
Super
A great app for communicating with tutors and others if you are unable to go to the college
Very nice aap
Wonderful app
Good
This app is nice but it should have private recording option and Full screen view .
"An amazing app!! It has its pros and cons over zoom, it has a lot of functions, offers a great deal of work that can be done through the platform, but it needs to have a more clean, and simple UI."
lags sometimes and messages cant be sent or files cannot be opened
Very effective app
Good
Good
Nice
"It's a really good online meeting stuff but you can provide more recorded videos (options) to phone ,like you do in pc website(teams)"
Hell

It's good
Sometimes loading very much
Experience is good Can be better if facility of viewing more number (around 15) of participants can be increased on screen.
It's really very good for online classes and to interact each and every attends.
"The camera doesn't work in the phone version. Please fix it. Other than that, amazing app."
On point like the features
"Teams App provides users numerous options to meet and share material. This is great ..but there are a few drawbacks.. 1.Sometimes participants get removed from meetings even after as meeting options are enabled, and there is no way to trace back the culprit. 2. It would be helpful if a co organizer could be assigned who would automatically have all the rights of the Organizer."
Its nice..buttt take alot of mbsðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.. but there is one issue that there is no privacy for number..
Has worked very well within Teams particularly when working from home.
ðŸ‘
Good
Very good app. Lot of features. But it's too hard to understand easily. Works well in relatively slower connection even in mobile data.
Best but we can not see full video in group meeting due to two dot (user ) image
Seamless! Fantastic! Flawless!
Whenever i enter into a meeting i am unable to view the screen shared by the host (*I have also tried various means to fix it like rebooting the device and etc) ...Hope u look into this matter seriously..regards..
Good
Good app buts needs alot of internet
It's quite good app.... But should provide some more features like recording the meating from teams in Ipad..
The excess complications can be reduced. But overall it is a great app!
The sound is clear and there usually no intermittent disruptions.
I'm using this app for online school. It's really good but I wish there was a way to delete messages
Good
The experience is very awesome. The application have a very great feature of assignments..... But they must enable the feature chat as well. It would become way better.
The app should notify us whenever a meeting starts. That would be useful.
Good app for study
I will give it three stars because sometimes we cant hear owners voice clearly but beside this i have wonderful experience with that so only fix voice problem. Thanks....
Good
Nice app for education and others ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘
"Only thing unsatisfied is, presenter window wont be shown full screen."
Very very very very nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ APP
Good app with no buffering and also works on low Internet connection
Good app for do meeting online but it hags so much on my PC that i have to use mobile.
Good
Do not consume too much internet data. Meeting sound is clear and one to another page loading is fast.
"It would be better if, we can able to see all pending or completed assignments of all teams at one place."
This app is good for my school online in uae so all download this app for your nice experience ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥°ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘..........
"Great app! The UI could be better, though."
Good app but makes the battery down very soon and sometimes the mic will not work . Otherwise it is a good app.
Too goodðŸ˜ƒ

Great app
Great communication tool. Easy to use.
Nice
"A very useful tool for online class. The only thing I would like to improve is how we can personalize our own account. Overall, a great app"
This is amazing for online classes but when any mam shares screen the comes low
Godd
OK
Decent but requires further functionality like ability to delete sent messages etc...
Nice app
Nice app ðŸ‘ it takes alot of time to open PDFs ... but still it's a good app â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
Great options compare to other meet apps specifically for students perspective....
Good
Good I like it
Good app
"If a total conversation saves as pdf, then it wll be perfect,and this app kills too much internet and charge...."
àª¸àª°àª³
Good
"The view frames in the mobile app can be worked upon. Rest, the app is a godsent."
Good
"It is great meeting app. It has many options like classwork, assignments, notes etc."
It's a good app for classes and meetings...
"I use it for my daughter's online school sessions in a tablet... To avoid proximity to screen, I cast it on tv. However, audio output remains in the Device. I have even tried connecting to speakers via bluetooth...does not work... Any solution? Otherwise, it is the best!!"
Ok
Good
Ok
It does not giving chatbox if it giving it is saying you are no longer particpant And it is also not showing hands up sign what i can do for showing these things
This app is very useful for children
It is a very good app but it's sound quality not good
Wow
Amazing application for online study .
This app is best for my meetings at home It has many good features This app is best
Very nice app
Cool apps
Mute problem
Please add the option to share audio with students when i am sharing a video..in laptop we get the option to share system audio but not on mobile..please add this feature to the app..it's very necessary
Its a good app where we can learn something good but the video quality could have been improved
Because this app is little bit irritating
Wonderfull app but atleast your files should be privte in uploading activities and your teacher is the only one who can read it to avoid copypaste output.
Its good
Amazing apps! Very easy for online schoolðŸŒ¼
Great
Really good app But still I am not able to change the background Neither on phone nor on laptop That's why 4 stars Otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Nice
Good app
Nice
Very comprehensive app and helps you to be more organized.
Getting difficult while copy text..
à¤—à¥à¤¡
Good! But sometimes this app gets hang and some features don't work properly...
Not bad
Best app ever but it sometimes get hang and do not respond
Useful
Quite convenient to use.
It's very hard to log in if you don't know to this app
It was a great app but it's sad that you can't be able to see all your classmates if your using a phone. There would be only 8 actually that you can see including yourself.
Good but it lags and hangs a lot
good
"My laptop tends to overheat on video chat. Otherwise, very useful."
"The interface could be improved, I did have a challenging time when locating which chat where and which meeting where."
"It's okay, just a little harder to manage on mobile that laptop/computerðŸ˜„"
Pretty reliability handles teams messages when im away from my work computer.
The only issue I have with this app is that the notifications don't show when I'm in a new group untill I turn it on manually. I don't know how to fix that.
cool app. android version doesnt allow replying in chat rooms
Does what I need. Good integration. I was confused for a while on how to adjust settings on chat notifications. A bunch of annoying emails of chat responses when I was offline. Stupid auto ft.
Teams has made WFH great. But the phone app tends to notify *before* my VPN computer. And I can't seem to control which channels should notify or not.
It's pretty nice experience using this app. It's a great way to simplyfying work environment and professional environment
Helpful tool to communicate securely within our business. Seamless integration with the rest of the Office 365 suite.
It's good to connect with phone.
why isn't background changes available on mobile app? I miss it.
when I first used this app it was fine but then every thing would freeze and my teacher and classmates had this same problem too so I rate this a 4 star
Its a good app. But need to upgrade the security
"The meeting board itself is great. Creating a meeting and inviting guests can be complicated, especially creating teams, and viewing and editing documents with people from other institutions"
Now okay for calls and video
Ok
"Teams is a good way to organise work teams with their online resources and have team specific chats, meetings, etc. It allows one to simultaneously work in the same document online. The only problem is when several team members work on the same document using their desktop app (e.g. Word, Excel) to edit. Then the result can be multiple versions (sync problem)."
Sometimes the meeting doesn't show up at all.. and then I miss my class and my bad grades shine
I need to be able to open different windows at the same time so I can check different teams and documents simultaneously!
Excellent
the quality of the call is good but you need a good network connection for better results so I want to say that it has to develop new features like we can weite also on the screen with various colours ....
It good for school things
Good but resource consuming
It is very usefull for when I have meetings.
"Good app, sometimes the call drops but still great"
I love teams
Please allow IOS 9 users to install this app for the students
User friendly app
"Overall good, but some lagging in syncing."
Easy to use. Sometimes my phone and laptop get out of sync.
"Teams is helping me. But I have only one issue that some times when you have to change a setting, you have to restart the app."
"The app is great, but sometimes it takes quite long to load."
"Great app, great for collaboration in a secure environment"
Very good
Suprr
It is a good app but clear chat option shild be there just like in whatsapp.
"It is very helpful, because if I forget what my homework was I could just check it in Microsoft teams."
Very good and useful app
App is ok. Need the ability to delete chats. Doesn't make sense to me.
Super
Good
Great for business and collaboration
Works well
Its really nice but teama depends on wifi alotðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Great
Its pretty nice but sometimes lags

Nice
I'm just trying to make the app stop bugging me for a rating.
"Es bastante util y recomendable, aunque es verdad que en determinadas ocasiones presenta problemas."
Nice
works great sometimes bugs
"I like it because using it for school, the kids can see you."
Its best but I am giving 4star because we cannot add a background in mobile and together mode should be enabled in mobile also and in mobile we cannot insert files in an channel. We can see file names for 10 sec only after disappears an uptade should their should be an feature that we should swlect which 8 people we want on our screen. I cannot see the whiteboard it is fully filled with black blanl surface this isssue should be solved.My voice is also not going there.
Nice app should try
Does what I need. Bit slow sometimes
Good but sometimes hangs
pretty good app but sometime notifications dont appear and also its difficult to forward documents / images & files
I can't change my background
"Muy buena, serÃ­a bueno que permita darle ""responder"" a los mensajes en el chat."
Pls add chat
"Love this app, there was an update for a few days where the emojis were part of the text box and the GIFs were easily accessible, then it disappeared. Any way to get it back?"
Great and easy way to communicate with colleagues
Overall it's a very good app. I like it. The only problem is that it's kinda hard to navigate through unlike it's desktop version . And a bit slow.
Great
Works well almost like the desktop app. Great to have on the phone as backup or when I'm out of the office.
Pretty decent app
Excellent
Good
Good app
It's Good
Nice. Practical and useful
Convenient way for me to communicate with other people at my workplace
"The app has continued to receive updates and now is one of the best options for online meetings and screen sharing. I would like more options to organize individual chat/contacts. Otherwise, this is one of the main tools I use when at work."
Awesome
Nice application to contact inside organisation....
You can be interactive and work together as team. Also user friendly
Very useful
Good
Very easy to use
Very good. Could be better to not disconnect with battery saving mode.
Awsome
Very nice app for meeting
"1. Fast , 2. Reliable and 3. Convenient. But not perfect, there are things I would prefer different. Like the removal of ""Company Portal"" as a dependency."
User friendly
It is useful for online classes
Helfull in 2020 pandemic time my college last year examination
Great team work app
Very intuitive and easy to use. Mobile app calendar on Android needs.to show more then one week. Not obvious the calendar can expand. Overall is making Covid corporate life easier!
"Inside organization experience is great, but if you are sending invite outside thd organization it is not sure the invited has received the invite or not."
Good... But consumes lot of ram memory
Excellent user interface that isnt too complicated. It integrates very well with other existing systems.
useful
Id give it a 5 star but.. It disconnects me in class often. But it is handy..
Verry Good for children
Good quality
Good app
Well good for calls and education
Works well both mobile and PC and I have found this a useful tool
I request to give us full screen option in more options in teams Android app while attending meetings
Good experience but can be best. There is sometimes a delay in uploading / displaying slides.
Good
Nice app
It is best app for meetings and online class
Nice
Nice op
Should be more light
Good functionality as long as all your team has access as well
Find it very useful and helpful. Great for teaching
It's great!
The best thing abt thus app isU can be in touch with your office colleagues from anywhere and on anytime
Nice interface and easy to use
it is really helpful for online lecture ðŸ‘ and also even assignment
Op
Cannot unmute other participants which is required for online exams.
Nice and easy to use . Great features
Good overall but can't load a Form added to a Teams tab. Asked to log in.
Great app to connect with team and customer. The only request I have for Microsoft is to keep this app light weight. Since the desktop version sometime behaves crazy and closes of randomly.
Super join classes aap
Good
"Good app for collabarating , the only thing which i dont like is app not that much speed as compare to zoom and i could see frequent disconnection in middle of calls , but i have stable WIFI ."
Microsoft is slowly fixing all the errors and bugs in this app is becoming better and better and has a lot of features which I absolutely love but the app is not completely free of bugs and needs some more attention.
Good
Working fine and effective...
Like this appp
Good to use for working purpose
Good
A bit slow but very good I use it for college classes
overall very good .
Generally pretty good. Syncing can be a bit slow or incorrect if using multiple devices. Messages also often fail to send. Much better in a listening role.
Bestest meeting app
Good app for collaboration
Good
Teams App on phone is so useful and user friendly! Love!
It's a nice app I can take screenshots well not like other apps. But it asks me to login every time I open this app.
"Good ..app for conduction various communication meeting, video conference."
It's nice application you can share and your documents and saved as well you can add some points inbuilt calendar and reminder.
It's a really good app but it's slow to show what's the organizer is screen sharing
A very safe and trusted app to use.
"It is a good app. In the time of lockdown because of COVID-19 I use it for online classes. But you should allow to make different volumes for different participants, as to hear a person with low voice you need to hear the others at a brain bursting volume."
Good
Very good
It's a good professional meeting app ðŸ‘
"Simple interface, easy to use. Love the dark mode. Could speed up a bit as sometimes when I click on a chat it takes a second longer to load."
Fairly good
Some are Removing so I did'nt like
Good
"Good UI, Easy to use, Smooth . But it lacks some features that other meetings apps have. Overall it's better for an educational meeting platform."
MS Team App is Excellent App for the entire office working from anywhere n best features are available in this App.
"To good app!! But ðŸ¤”there is no option for sharing audio and video,you can only share video not both things at a time(in android) you must do something about it"
I am not able to submit one of my assignments... I had a test and submitted my assignment but unfortunately it has not been indicated in my teachers mob... Other than this issue I am quite satisfied with this app...
There is only one limitation like connectivity issue...
Really very excellent appp for study purpose alsoo

aacha hai bahut aacha hai
It is useful for me to attend the meeting with my school to study Also with my friends
"Great app, so far i can view pdf files on my mobile and the planner does not notify my of any notes added to my task unless i have commented on it."
"Why you all have removed the edit and delete chat option ? Please bring it back , please , i am requesting"
Foog
Good for work at least
"The app is wonderfull now after the update it works nicely and does not hangs between the meetings but the app crashes sometimes and i have to wait for sometime for opening it , i would suggest to download the app if you want to complete your meetings without any problem. ðŸ˜Š"

"We are unable to delete the messages , plz look into that issue Plz If we want to delete a message It cannot be deleted And chats in the Teams app are not private The illustrator or the teachers are able to read each and every chat ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸"

Very good. Depends on the net connectivity.
THIS APP IS AWESOME FOR STUDENTS AND FOR OTHER PEOPLES. IN WHICH WE CAN ATTEND CLASSES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM .IT HAS ALL FEATURES THAT REQUIRES FOR ONLINE TEACHING .BUT STILL THERE IS PROBLEM OF REMOVING SOMEONE FROM MEETING IN CLASS BY OTHER PARTICIPATE S .IT CREATED DISTURBANCE IN STUDYING .OK THANKS.
Sometimes the voice problem takes place other than that this is a great app. All credits goes to you.
Teams was good but the thing of attendee organizers/presenters not good all should be organizers/presenters
This app was very professional and well organized.
"I have been using it to my online classes it's gradually excellent to use this app it need full net oralsee it disconnects and tell us to reconnect the meeting so,the last update is very interesting it has 8 icons that I like the most students cannot admit their friends only teachers can admit so,update it to admit by all it's fantastic opportunity to use this appðŸ˜„ðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
its nice
Give an option where we can see the online class as video in background Also.. meaning as outside the app..in background... otherwise it's nice ðŸ‘
Best but apps are a lot
"Hi, the experience is very good but when I use headphones or without headphones as well the participants cannot hear me so could you please resolve this issue?"
"The Best app, just have one defect that it doesn't show who is removing us (students) from the class meeting. It really frustrates but other than that it's the most efficient app."
Nice
"Great app, but we can't access previous recordings through mobile."
Best app to learning online class
It's worth
Good App with too.many options but take time to adopt for this app.

Nice app
Its user friendly and very useful app.
Oke siap
Screen freezes some time
Good
It take a lot of net
Very easy to join meetings and has cool features for online meetings
Takes half of data of a day
Ok
Need more functions like wassap
Working good...Great app for online meeting
Very nice
This app is damn good but there is only on one corn of this app and that is recordings are saved for only 20 days please try to set it permanent or atleast 2 months
A very integrated app for collaborative work. Needs substantive improvement to be user friendly especially when jumping across menus
When compared to old version new version not consume more data but because of this while in meeting it disconnected sometimes. So improve the enough consumption level of data.
It is a very good app
Teams is a nice way to communicate with team members.
Usually works really well. Occasional glitches
Sometimes its confusing.
This is good for office purpose app
works pretty well
Exceptional
So far works good. No issues observed. But few features are missing.
Teams is fine as a chat window I am not accross it further than that. However some functionality is different on phone versus PC like file sharing in chat.
A veces se satura y se inutiliza temporalmente
Missing a notes feature to make more dinamic clases
"App is good, but everyday I have to switch vetween accounts and go through the introduction each time. Why don't you just allow us to merge accounts?"
Nice
Seems decent. Could use some improvements such as tips or prompts to help with issues such as take control being enabled to everyone even though there is a simple fix.
It's great but they could improve on lodeing everything faster
Good... Once you get used to it.. Still need a laptop application to fully utilise Teams
Handy app. A lot of features to use.
"So far so good- switched to Teams and onenote for teaching high school ELA. It is a little overwhelming at first, but jumping between courses (teams) on the app is rather simple. I will have to give an updated review when I grade with a rubric, but quick submissions and feedback seem straightforward too."
"It's functional, yet there are some problems with the wifi connection , it disconnect even if I'm close to it, but in overall I find this app a better option to zoom. Funciona, tiene algunos problemas con la conecciÃ³n wifi, se desconecta aÃºn si estoy cerca de ella, pero en general encuentro la app como una mejor opciÃ³n a zoom."
Very quick and responsive.
"Great app., lots of options, works well both on main system or remotely on cell or tablet."
"New Review / Sep 2020 The App is good, still a bit heavy, require a lot of device resources and bandwidth compared to similar Apps. Prior Review / Jun 2019 Good App, it will be great if we can share the screen from the smartphones too. The App performance is OK in general, but sometimes stop sending messages and receives only!"
i would have given ita five but due to COVID i do online school but Assignments seems to keep sending me to an error screen even though it was working fine before! Pls fix this
A great tool for communication and coordination. Still needs a little work on the project mangement tabs. The interface is confusing and hard to figure out
It is working verry good
It works
Much better than Skype.
Great tool. It is evolving nicely.
"Easy to use, real time!"
"Hasta ahora va muy bien, aunque podrÃ­a mejorar la visibilidad para los dispositivos mÃ³viles"
Good team collaboration app with good feature set!
Good..needs better response emoji
It really useful.
Nice
great but sometimes it kicks u out of calls and stuff little bit of mic delay either than that great
"Still some issues to improve, like the data demand while starting"
"Great app it's totally great we can make groups, chat with eachother and taking meeting in only one app good app for online classes and office work."
Good

"Loving this app, I think i may soon stop using slack now, finding teams more user friendly"

"Works well, but not on data"
This is nice but today it is not working on my pc i have done restart many times but still not working on pc
Ok
Good app
App works well although I do find the interface to be confusing to navigate.
I can't figure out how to get a virtule bsckround
Optimal for business
it is ok i have got to understand it but it does take time to get use to when you start to use it
"User friendly, and good to communicate with people"
Good app but difficult to sign inðŸ‘ðŸ‘
"Well designed, works well"
Good. I wish it was less clunky when splitting and changing screens when sharing.
Great experience!!
Very.good
Good
"Very nice app, I like it very much."

Am colegi care nu pot folosi aplicatia pe Huawei. Dupabce se descarca nu au opÈ›iunile de logare. Ce e de facut? Eu am un Samsung si nu am probleme
Very good
It's a very great app with many things you can use to communicate and learn through. The only thing I would want them to fix is that the video quality.
I'm bored
good for school
Good. Freezes once in a while. But good.
I think you should add a feature where you delete anything on the feed
Great
Wonderful App my meeting was very nice
I love the app but I would give it 5 stars if it had the link
Sound was good today
Great
"It works beautifully on the phone. Teams calls could however be improved on to log attendees who have actyally joined or left the call. As a presenter, I find it difficult to track in between the call to find out who all have joined or left the conversation."
Fast and reliable so far.
Very handy! Congratulations ðŸ‘ Some chat notifications won't disappear. You should fix that!
"Efficient with real time services. Perfect for working at home and being connected to peers for chat, meetings etc."
good for class
"You are annoying on android. It kicked me out for 2 weeks stating network issue, but fixed just in time for me. So 4 stars."
It's really good.
Work direct comms nation wide.
I love this app!! It helps so much with my school work! Only problem I have with it is the connection.
Good
Missing some features but overall great app
It is an amazing app for childrens education keep going on like this
So great it is hard to log in but the app is really good and it does not mute your mike and you cant unmute like it does in zoom
"I really like this app, but... It's so hard to delete the accounts I don't use anymore. So if u fix it, I will give you 5 stars!"
"Good App for school purposes. A little hard to navigate at times, but otherwise it's an decent app."
Solid experience
"Good app, recent updates brought along new useful features. Opening files troubles many times though."
Experience is going good
you can use this for almost anything..thing is when i join my classes it lags so much to te pint i have to leave the meeting and comeback. sometimes it even logs me out! please fix this or else this will become a 1 star
Really love this app
i like
Some times...the screen went off during class. I need to lock it and open it. please fix it..
Good but improve sound
It's user friendly
"Microsoft Teams is great, and it offers so much cool stuff! If I had to nitpick, it would be about 3 small things: 1) It would be amazing if more than 1 person could share screens in a call. 2) It would be nice if in the PC, Mac, or Desktop version of the app that we could select a message in a chat to specifically reply to. 3) I'd really love some more emojis. ðŸ˜"
"Love it! Very easy to use to schedule and conduct meetings. Able to speak with coworkers without having to use phone and passwords. Much better than blue jeans, Skype, and zoom in my opinion."
It's is nice to use for online class
Nice
"I hate the assignments section, you have to select the subject in order to show you assignments, would it easier if it'd show all the assignments sorted out in a list?"
"Very useful app. Particularly appreciate that one can find everything in one place. However, it really needs a screen annotation feature that can be viewed by all participants"
Very user friendly for all technology skilled levels.
Highly productive
Great app but it is a little slow at some times I guess everyone is using it at one time. It is a great app.
Very good.
Excellent app.microsoft has done a great job
Too good

It's good but....the thing in which we can only see 8 people is worst thing...which i hate because sometimes we want to see everybody which is impossible in this app
"I really like it, as I use it to chat with a friend of mine, and school"
So far so good. It's perfect but then what app is. Prefer the desktop app in general.
Good
Nice
Its a great
The app is very good. But it consumes a lot of data and of high speed. Please fix that.
Good
Very good performance and perfect options
This app is good but the reson i have given 4 stars bevause i provides every thing but i am not getting +calender option by which we can creat a meeting so please help
It's good for educational purposes and you can improve more functions in calendar block because at sometimes they are not showing the time for the classes.
Nice
Nice but I think you should add more features
Nice experience with learning in ms teams
I like this educational app which help us to continue our school class . And its features are awesome but there is no option to delete. Try to improve it.
"This application is amazing, but the fact due to which I am giving 4 stars only is that screen freezes a lot. If you think that's a network problem. Then you are most probably wrong because my Wi-Fi provides me with an amazing internet speed."
Overall good experience Can do almost everything in the mobile app as in desktop application There is slight issue of synchronization of the msgs between desktop and mobile
nice app for students
Nice response ðŸ˜Š
Power automate is not working in mobile app
Hey whenever I open assignment it doesn't open.do something
Nice App and Good Experience in Using Teams .
"Using MS Teams brought me with a new experience, not only online learning, but also a new way in communicating with people."
It's exceptional
Really good app for school work and work but the connection sometimes is a little bit weird you can see the presentations really clear and everything was really good.
Very reliable and very simple to use
Very flexible and audible
There is a glitch in the phones that sometimes is says faild to send a message but when I hop on my pc I never faced it
Good
Really good...and its really smooth for classes
"this app is much more better than zoom . it have some features and specific conditions to give good result like your network should have to be good at all ,then every thing would soughted out .Otherwise nothing would happen just wait for your network connection. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ˆ"
App is good More improvements should be there

Good but i have no recording option
A bit complicated but has a lot of features
Good
It is best for online classes but it will be stucked after few minutes it is also helping for studies also we can share screen ....
It has good network but takes a lot of data
"I hope in the next update if you can improve it more,and make it like how it is on pc or laptop. Also when the meeting start it doesn't show up immediately, and I hope that if we can see how many persons are in the meeting in the next update."
Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø±Ù†Ø§Ù…Ø¬ Ø±Ù‡ÙŠØ¨ Ù…Ø±Ø©
Took some time getting used to but overall very useful and we'll made
Works as intended
ðŸ‘
Update is very bad. It's harder to submit assignments.
"Good app for college, makes it much easier because everything is in one place and the mobile app runs much smoother than the web based version"
Teams is good good download
I have used teams for colege work and have found its harder to register and get logged in that use the actual app.
It's good just a bit annoying when it takes ages to load and it lags too much.
Should have a tab for images
Easy to use.
Fast and add free
Great when used correctly.
amazing app. but it drains alot of battery. a bit laggy
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Good program
Most of the time getting hanged and good on chat and videos
Good appðŸ‘
Good
"This is too good o can do my tests,notebook work i can send in only in this app amd more things o can do but there is one problem i can't able to remove profile picture in this app so i rate 4 stars"
Good
The app is superb but what makes me upset is excessive lagging of software. Whenever I try to join through my laptop it starts lagging . Few images which I share are unable to view with sometimes chat box too disabled. I hope u will look out! Anyways my overall experience with this app in kinda good!
Good one Thanks
Good

Yasir Rahman
Its little little fineðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Very nice app and easy to use.
The best app I found. It is very convenient and helpful. There are every features that other apps do not. However the reason for rating is 4 star is that on an early update there came a call option from which we can call our frnd or teachers personally. That feature was extremely nice. But after the latest update that feature is removed which I think was very useful. So it's my request to bring that feature back
Just a bit slow... But useful and nicely designed...
UI is greate
Very nice application but it can be better than this time
Could you add facility to switch easily between two accounts. Currently I need to login when I switch between accounts
"Its easy to use for online virtual classes. Liked it's features setting dates for assignments, uploading videos, ppts, or any other files is so easy"
After the latest update Teams requires me to uninstall and install it every single day in order to be able to open it. Other than that it's great.
Easy to use
Only 4 stars
It's good but needs improvement. Its consuming more data.
Sux on video conf but ok on chat stuff
Very good app for me to attend online class but i gave only 4 star because there is a bug that id i cut any call from my notification center and i will press to attend another class the screen will become black so plz repair this bug soon and solution for this bug is clear the app from recents and open the microsoft teams again the bug will be clear
If we attend class in phone or tab we don't have a option as background effect.....
The awesome aap for learning online
Nice app for online classes. I am student I can tell thet this app is amazing. But their should more updates.
It's very very great app for students due to this pandamic situation but one thing i don't like is in pc when i am open chat while in metting it show me the latest messages but in android when you open chat section it show me the previous messages alse its very difficult to go down for looking new messages please fix it and made it like in pc version btw nice app and very usefu l:)
Nice

"Bri ahe app.mst background la kay krtou kalat nahi te br ahe,ðŸ˜‚thoda range nsel ki problem yetoy.. An balence pan det java saglyna thoda app ldun"
Best but need more user friendly
Everything in the app is nicely maintained and really a help for all. Just one issue. The app opens up itself on Laptop/computer eeven if we dont want to open it. Pls look into this problem otherwise the app is ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘.
Good app for working people...
It's very good but needs better things
Very nice app
The best to communicate effectively between two devices...
Good for studying
Weird
Very useful for meetings....
Updating it makes the app glitch
Files expire
Friendly and good to use..
Good app
It is really good only it hangs a lot
"It is just an amazing app to take meetings..... They might be school or office meeting. But many times the teams app needs full Internet, and if your Internet is just a little low, it still disconnects you. I think that there should be the capacity for this app to at least adjust a little bit when a user has just some Internet missing to get exact Internet. If this feature comes as soon as possible, this is the best meeting app for me. Just amazing! ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ðŸ˜"
It's a good app but in between the video is used to pause.
this app is great
Good

Nice app
"I like it very usefull, but there is Some missing icon like calender and metting"
Good
Nice
i think they should show the video of everyones' video who are in the meeting
Excellent experience ðŸ‘
See this is astonishing app bt somewhere of course it builds up some problems. I love using is app very useful in attending my daily classes. It have all the options. It is far better than zoom app.
Perfect ðŸ‘
I am giving 4 â­â­â­â­ because where is the raise hand âœ‹option? And can't put virtual background in meetings.
Somtimes it hangs and uses a lot of data
nice app and it is useful but one dissapoint is while messging sometimes it is hanging and gifs are too slow
Let us record the video individually as of our need.Right to record is given to the organizer which makes us dissapointing.Let the recorded video be saved in the internal storage of our device.Hope this can done.
Good
Nice experience easy to attend meetings
I would be nice if all the members of the meeting are visible...... Apart from that everything is great ðŸ‘
Good
It's a rlly nice app..... just please add a feature of blocking I rlly need it âœŒï¸
Good
"I prefer MS Teams rather than Zoom. Since I used zoom last sem for online class I can differentiate the two. Using zoom is difficult wherein I experienced lots of problems connecting and joining the class. While in zoom, you can easily join classes but there are minimal technical problems."
Works ok
"Still need improvement for join meeting with video or camera, otherwise sound is clear and good"
Very Good App .......
It's great ai am enjoying my class but there is some room for improvement Plzzz make it easy for user it's little tricky Also there are some bug fix that.
"It's a great app but there are a few problems that I experienced while using it like overlapping of sounds when two or more person speak at the same time, frozen screen, sometimes you can't add or invite the person in a chat or call, it takes a lot of effort to do this. Overall, it is still a great app, I hope you fix the problems that I have mentioned as soon as possible because it is currently used as a platform for online classes. Thank you!"
Cool but little bit hanging problem
Easy to use and good for working from home
Team app is best for me
Lol online class bcoz of this ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜­
Nice
Beautiful app
It's very nice app but may be it will take more internet data then zoom classes
"The app is great to use. It would be great if we could get a floating picture in picture mode for the meeting when content is being shared. Bugs, Whenever I turnoff the audio for the meeting the audio for my whole device gets muted."
Very good for online classes but sometimes video quality is not so good.
Not able to know who is removing from meeting. By this whenever i am removed i not able to got that person
good
Sebenar nya sudah bagus namun terkadang eror dengan log out sendiri atau bahkan nge hank saat pertemuan
Very good app
Nice app
Great app for online learning.Nice programming
"it's a very good app if seen for projects, assignments and meetings. But it has a small problem for me. It just doesn't show me any outside contacts rather than those that I already have in my group. I don't know if this problem occurs to you also, but it's not a big one. Very efficient app. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
Worst app
It's really cool still getting used to it though!
It is best for online classes but we want background change while using phone in a call please

Easy to use. Reliable ðŸ‘
ITS NICE BUT IT USES A LOT OF NETWORK THATS WHY 1 STAR OFF ðŸ˜€ MY MOST FAVOURITE THING IN THIS APP IS RAISE HAND! I JUST LOVE THIS APP IT HELPED CONNECT WITH MY FRIENDS
Good
Very useful for school but it's quite annoying that you have to click each class to see the assignments it would be better if it just showed all of them and when they are due
File can't open why ðŸ˜’ðŸ¤¥ðŸ˜’ðŸ™„
The app is not as much expected for the online classes and whenever we are going to sign in into the account it asks for user id and password a number of times. Well it's although a good app but not as much expected for the above reasons.
I had rated this app as 4 star because I should have the option to reset the password as soon as we want rest it is very nice app working smotthly. Hope you fill fix this problem as soon as possible. â˜ºï¸
This app is the best for each and every student specially in this times for online lecture And I gave this app only 4stars becausethe problem is it uses too much of data...so pls make changes so that we can use this app without any complaints or data problems... Thank u for reading
Fantastic!

"Please, improve your app icon for android 8+ with adaptive icon, because it looks bad when I use different shapes for system icons in my Google Pixel 3"
It's the best online meeting app i've ever used so far. But it might be better if you do some review on the mobile version of the app. It's lagging/not even appeared at all sometime when i try to join meetings that already started.
Use too mauch data
Good
The only downside is you can't see the categories placed when using the mobile app unlike in the website.
Rajni Patel super& very smart work
I like the his aap
Very nice app no problem but some time it works very slow. Other all is very nice
"I wish the desktop app would have a reply feature. I am rating MS Teams service overall and not the ""andoird version"" only"
It's all my fate but it is useful ðŸ¥±
It's good in terms of keeping in touch with students. It would have been good if there was a way to recover class notebooks after deleting it
Preferred for Official meetings. Comfortable UI and functions. Good Work Microsoft ðŸ‘

Need to be able to share streams with people outside of our organization.
Good
It's great!
It's good but I have some problems in facing the chats. When I open the chat option it says we can't get conversation and shows something went wrong
Nice
Well it's better than computer software.
"Many features! Use it all the time and like that they added multi tasking options like chat pop out. While it lacks some organization tools and features, it works well for calling and I like it for chats that do not need to be retained beyond 30 days. When they introduce some better tools and features to help find, organize, sort, and filter, it will be even better (for me anyway)."
"Once mastered, navigation is relatively easy."
Best app....
Good but hard to use .!??

An effective app to use.
Very good sound quality. It would be great if it could ring participants when a meeting is started.
Good
Very good
Please bring back the full screen mode. It's quite honestly not the same without it

It is good for teachers and students but sometimes my shared screen doesn't appear to the attendees and when there is poor connection it directly hangs up...
Sometimes Teams is restarting at the time meeting start. I am not sure about exact reason
It lacks something
Easy to manage between cpu and phone.
Nice and great
Sometimes it make some issues and creating problem in our device
This app helps me much for me as a teacher for online classes

Good but sometimes it doesn't work properly
Stu Rx FG uh so
This is great app but it has its minuses like it laggy sometimes there is voice lags cam lags and sometimes mic doesn't work but other than that it's cool
Would have given this a five-star had they had a reply function in chat :)
Makes online studies easy
"Great experience had in teams it's new to me not all seen before like this , leaning new things every day and ourselves updating and so many options available for better comfortable and yeah it's good"
"The app is really good ,but the problem is that even though after doing only me students are getting removed and muted by other one .Is there any technique to rectify this problem.Expecting changes in the next updation"
Good app for teaching learning purposes But i get advertisements in middle of an meeting
Its good
Great App but lags sometimes.
Nice
Good to use except for some itches which may be due to network.
This app is Excellent in the pc version especially after the new update which includes large gallery and together. Also the mode in which we can add background effects is like icing on the cake ðŸŽ‚ but why all this in pc version only. So I kindly request microsoft team to add such features in mobile version also which will add to the accuracy of the appðŸ™pls add features in mobile version. The non- accuracy and less features In mobile version gave it 4 stars
User friendly
Good app
Very good app but because of it my phone hangs
Good
Very good for online class
Great it works out better for schools and work
Good app for meating
It is the best app for me to study in lock down I love this app thank you
It's nice to being with
I like this app to much
Well something are good of this app like its microsoft video calls or screen sharing or its block account facility given by ms to overcome the fees problem by an institution or school.But it also have some minor problems like it don't allow you to give the assigmnents on the time or by your choice but that is like the real yest of it . So we gotta see what is going to happen from it.Thank you microsoft Association for making such a windurfull app and thank you bill gates for making MicrosoftðŸ¤—.
Best app for meetings but the problem is of network otherwise it's best of all meeting app
Microsoft teams is a really good app. I have been using this app for more than 2 months now for attending the online classes of my PU College. This app is reliable. All you need to have is a good network connection. Thank you MS teams.
I would have been given it 5 stars if it would have the option for attendees to invite someone .
I am not able to use stream app within it but its a good app...
Hi. i can't find recorded meeting in teams. how can i find?
How can we store and control our personal data
Nice app
Works better in the mobile than in a desktop.
I really like this app but it can be more better because in laptop it's perfect but in phone it does not work
Nice app to interact each other ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
Ok
"Very nice app for online classes n meetings, But, white board can not being recorded and consumes much data"
Nice app for studies and secured
Please improve the comments section as we have to scroll through entire conversation to reach the current one Please have some changes so that we can access previous comments also But opening new comments on tapping screen
Very good
It's good
Nice â˜ºï¸
Gud
Nice
Perfect app for studing
Best app i ever seen for managing meetings.
I like this app very much I can use for online classes but my friends are have set background option and I don't have that option. Can you tell me why I can't see the option? I am using Windows 8.
Nice one
Good app
Very good experience
Nice it is A great app .because if it is choose for college students to use the online classss
Sometimes it hangs unexpectedly.
"It actually stops{Hang} sometime in some phones, I think you should improve the thing, rest is all best, excellent, that's why it is also used by many people in this pandamic."
This is a nice app but sometimes in the call echoing starts so i wish that in the next update this problem is fixed. Thnk u for making this very very useful app.
"Tapping on the notification icon doesn't take me back to app. Instead, it takes me to another app which is already open."
Best
There is a problem that is we can see only 8 participants that's why I am giving 4star
You need to fix some audio issue
"If there could be an easy tutorial on how to use this app, it would be so better. Could you please add some"
It is very easy to use but there is one problem that we can see only 4 person at a time .It is not like zoom app that we can see everyone at a time so I want that to improve it ok. And now we as a student want more and more better enhancement in the app so that we can use it wisely. Some more features should be added so that teachers can control the students . We want the next of the app
Mam not connected
Good software
Nice
I ll give 4 stars because it wil ask sign in so much ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
Very user friendly and easy to use..while some improvements can be made like function to add people from external organization while having an internal call
Nice
Initially I was using that other apps for meeting and sending the works .when I downloaded the Microsoft team .it is easy to all.but one thing. I'm from rural area student .so I didn't get sufficient net work
Nice app but there are problems with some of the users because of the server problems please take a look on it and clear it in next update. Then I guarantee you 5 star
"Love teams, works so smoothly"
Good but still lacks at use of data
Good app
It is slow sometimes
MY SCHOOL USE IT FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES SO I EXPRIECNCE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SLIDER IN CHATBOX FOR EASY VIEW OF COMMENTS AFTER IT IS A PERFECT APP I AM HAPPY WITH IT ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
Gr8 app and good features overall nice for students ðŸ‘Œ
Excellent
Its better than the zoom aap..its sound quality is awesomeðŸ‘
NICE
Ok
"Does its job, no bugs or anything to complain about. Would like to have a block option though."
I do some school on here! It's a really great app although it does tend to freeze alot but that's normal! You definitely need this app for video call and if your a student this a fantastic app. Definitely request!!
"It can improve, but is very clear"
In my opinion this app is fantastic. It is not only incredibly accessible but also has many features that allow you to continue with your studies remotely. I have experienced very few faults if not any faults in the six months I have been using it for homeschool work. The video and audio quality was good but this may depend on your device and Internet connection. For me it was a great way to communicate with teachers and for handing in assignments. Overall good app from Microsoft ðŸ‘
I Thought This Was Going To Be A Tele-Conference Training With An Instructor. I Could Not Get Access To The Training Manuals. I was successful In Completing The Docu-Sign App. Though. I'm Guessing That Was The Training Exercise.
Good
"Great app, getting better all the time"
This is bad app
Easy to use. The desktop app is better than the mobile app - it tends to be slower. I use it for work and my son's home school communication and it's very simple.
Teams is an app with so much potential. Keep improving it Microsoft. We just need better video calling experience some sort of gallery view would be amazing.
Pretty handy but sometimes I experience slowness. Overall pretty satisfied with the app.
"It's almost a good app but not suitable for quizzes because if by mistake you click on submit button it gets submitted and your marks can be deducted. By this means it's good for classes, Assignments but not for quizzes. For a better experience, teams have to add a confirmation button for submission of test or quizzes."
"Works great for communication, document sharing and teleconferencing. My only dislike is I have not found a way to delete conversations and they're all on my screen. Plus I don't like the idea that the company can pop in and see all the past conversations."
Good
Some times the material is not shown in files (some students didn't receives material)
It is very convenient especially as I become more comfortable with it.
Very nice
I like that MicroSoft Teams is synced-in with my Outlook Calendar. Hence it sends me reminders of the meetings. I also like that a participant of the meeting can call me directly from the on- going meeting to join in. Two great features for a busy work schedule. Kudos!
"So far so good, I think some features could be made simpler, but overall a good App"
its very good it has all my metings im order
Generally very good.
Good
Excellent
Good quality
I didn't try the app but I'm just rating 4 for fun sorry if it's not 5. I'm trying to help. Have a good day bye-bye <3
I USE THIS FOR SCHOOL AND I REALLY LIKE ITðŸ’‹ðŸŽ¤â™¥ï¸
Nice features. User friendly. Look and feel may be improved
Works fine.
Till now teams was allright but now i dont know some times voice does not go or come sometimes screen is not bieng shared and the assighnments are also not uploading
Easy to use. Though I wouldn't mind having a frequent contacts or custom contacts feature.
"glitches a lot but great app, I use it every day and it somtimes it just is the best app ever!"
It's Very Useful for schooling students..But one problem we can't clear chats like whatsapp...Thank You...ðŸ˜Š
"You do get a little lost with all the controls, but overall its a great app."
Interesting
Good entertaining games
Decent
When network not available or low working when this app not useful
Good
the experience is overall nice although the app closes by its own sometimes while im in an ongoing call meeting so that bothers me sometimes. however i want to give a suggestion though can you allow phone support for custom backgrounds? i feel like that would be a very convenient to users with running issues on how their background looks like and also for their privacy. keep up the great work! looking forward to your new features in the future!
A good tool for covid-19 working at home.
Maturing rapidly. Starting to be easy and natural to use. Finally allowing seamless inside and outside org collaboration
Exellent user experience Gentle learning curve
So far so good
Best educational app
Its a good app I like it for online classes but it also comes to a problem were others can't hear you and you are speaking.
Works period. Only enhancement I want to see is audio alerts
A good system
Works very well
Nice
App is good
It is decent enough
Good experience.
Log in issue has problem.
Please go back to the option of having 1 screen instead of multiple screens
"My there is a nice app but the only problem is that it has now enabled private chat so now if you want to tell something to someone then you have to either say it in front of everyone for tell that person on whatsapp but when it added the private chat feature it was useful now it has become a problem I hope that they bring back the private chat option and it's my humble request as it was very useful,other wise this app is great and very useful specially during this lockdown"
Great app for team huddle..
"Sometimes the video freezes especially at one hour but my friend and I were having fun with it. You can change your back round, but I don't know how. The app is pretty awesome. You can't see all of the faces on a computer but on mobile devices you can see everyone in the call."
Good
Good
This app is sporadic in giving notification. So not very helpful ðŸ˜

Good medium to use for a large collective of people glitches at times but that could be based on on individual home network providers or the weather

Very useful
Best oke
Excellent
Very very goodðŸ‘
I wish you could see everyone on the screen in a call as this would be very helpful for uni
Good app for official purposes
I have not faced any problem yet. This app is really helpful for online classes.
The app is nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ but if connectivity is nice then also the call gets hang ðŸ˜
Should've been faster.
"I use this for video conferencing with colleagues. It works well, but is not quite as full-featured as the Windows version. However, since it is fairly quick on my Chromebook, reliable, and has most of the important features I find it a useful tool to have."
Just started using! Would very much like the blur background feature to be implemented on this version thoughs is my only quarrel for online classes!
Some time the vedio gets halved when I turn my smartphone. Only in this app I am facing this type of problem. Please help me.
Great app
"It's very good, but it has problems with the camera meeting. The camera sometimes blocks for the whole meeting and that's not a very comfortable thing for important meetings."
It's a good app. I like the sound quality
Full screen mode is removed
"so far so good, but i get no notifs. it's really hard to constantly open the app and check for updates from teachers."
Better app for online teaching and business
Now I can call my work colleagues and supervisor cos we are in different offices. I can see notification on my email too. Teams on android phone is supper!!
Best app ever
Good for online classes. Sometime it hangs and there are glitches which should be fixed otherwise this app is great.....
"Good, quick updates from multiple people in our various teams groups"
Great app ðŸ‘
Please add filters because when I see my classmates my eyes hurtsðŸ˜
It's a great of...I am fresh in company and my company uses it for training us.... one think I suggest is fast forward facility for already recorded meet ... so that I can review it quickly Thank you.
Absolutely awesome ðŸ‘Œ
Great
Good
Nice and a good app
Good
"The best app for teaching and collaboration. I would like to suggest a few features though: - I would like to see some additional background features like animated gif as background, video loop as background etc. Also the background pic gets flipped (mirror effect) and I always forget to manually flip and save it before hand. So please fix it. - Auto recording feature/seting for the meeting. - Live poll/voting which can also work as quiz with correct answer."
When i updated this app its start making problem for me i can not take my classes because when i join the class my class are going to ended by itself
Should be more user friendly
"Pretty good app, though there is a problem. Sometimes if someone speaks it will some times provoke an ""eco"" and if many persons speak at the same time, the ""eco"" gets worse, i cant even hear the teacher. This ""eco"" really annoys me and my ears. Hope you can fix it. Anyways, other then that, the app is pretty good for teachers and students. And sometimes it disconnects even if my internet is good. But still, pretty good app."
Good surves
Good app for meetings and connforence calls
Best for communication and calls between teams and colleagues and no need to swap between multiple apps for file sharing
Difficult to start easy afterward
Good ðŸ™‚
"Great tool, love it"
Nice
This app works perfect but video quality of this app is not as good as aspected the screen share is also a bit blur and rest all things are good also we can chat with each other this is a good app I prefer that you should download it. Thank you for reading and also thanks to Microsoft for making this app.......
I would like to say that the app is quite good but the reason behind rating 4 stars that it doesn't have the feature of background effects in the phone as well as in some pcs and laptops.
"Works well enough, some messages are a bit late sometimes"
Great app. No problems on my side thus far
This app is very good but some issues in this app. Like as storage is high and video quality is poor.
It is a nice app but having one small problem that when network is slow we are not able to see screen and voice is having problem we are not able to hear clear voice
Nice for team meeting management.
This app was very helpful for my online classes
This app is good but sound is not clear and this app you will join metting
Its a great tool for online meeting
Okay
Excellent apart from screen sharing doesnt allow you to share all at once
ðŸ‘
Very good app
If only it could show how it is on a computerized on the phone
"This is a good app, perfect for virtual classroom teaching. However, I would really wish it has a feature of distributing students in small temporary groups during the class for activity and small groups tasks. Where group A wouldn't be able to see and hear thier group B discussions. This feature would make this app 1000 times better than Zoom."
"I don't really get notifications after closing the app for a while. This is why I am giving it 4 stars. If that can be fixed, this will be a five star app. Thank you microsoft."
Its a good app but take lots of data
Actually I should give you 5 stars for the web version but in the desktop app it is coming that try signing out and in I did it 50 times but it is not coming so please fix this problem for the desktop that's why I am giving you only 4 stars
Best app for online period and chatting with friends
Very easy to use and so much to do with it....ðŸ™‚â˜º
Nice for on line class
It is a good app to get stuck in online be classes
This App helps use work remotely and we are able to still work as a team effectively

It's good but when I used 1st time it's deficult to me how I operate it after some time I easyly operated it .ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Good
Reason for giving 4 stars is u should add virtual background for android mobile and tablet as well
It sometimes get disappered from chache
Can Microsoft give us clear reason for this firebase issue aka the FCM test notification?
Gud
This is very good app
Itsban good app for communication but it's very complecated and there is a huge problem when someone starts screenshare
Experience was amazing but I gave 4/5 because this launcher can't show or unable to pin the apps that are cloned my system os My system os is Colour UI os there's default app cloner in settings but cloned are displayed in app drawer in this launcher Plz fix this bug for our smooth experience
Good
Good
Good app. Works well to have web meetings and share documents
Good
This app most important too study
Good apps
good for small group meetings.
It is good for students school work
The app itself is very helpful for classes but there are a lot of bugs in the android version.One of them is that in files sections in a team you can see the files only for 2 seconds and then they disappear. And please give background effects for the android version .
Nice app for school but when I sit on my table chair then only bit slow net work comes then the call is droped.
Best app for meetings
Very good app for STUDENTS who can not go to school during this corona pandemic....... Quality of call is also good in the app i like this
Best
Good
It is a nice apk but the reason i gave 4 star is that it take a lot of timenti sing in and if we don't join the meeting thruohh the calender their is no option of chhating so that's why I gave it 4 all otherwise it's is awesome appðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤Ÿ
Very nice
Ya the ap is nice for students to litsen classes and even to attend mettings
It's super....
Everything is superb just the feature of removing someone without his name disclosed is bad. Often mischievous people disturb others during meeting.
"Actually i like the app. I have a suggestion. Add widgets and floating buttons for the mobile app to improve multitasking and user experience. If ms does that, i will give 5 stars."
Dharimik
This teams app is really awsome but i had a problem that I could not share my system sound in my android phone so I am not able to share my video while doing my presentation please I request you to include system audio in the android version
"The Admin cannot stop the Meeting Room, it's so inconvenient."

Good for online classes
This is a very good online class app.
"Awesome app to use for a meeting ðŸ™‹â€â™€ï¸..,but there are few undeveloped material were we can't enjoy.. like in mobile or in tab if we screen share there is no option for sharing sound ðŸ˜• and also this app need to download other apps too"
V r having learning experience.
Good App
Good and best app
Good app
Well it is good app but some times it disconnect from the meeting.
Good for mobile but not for pc and laptops And there delete message options
Nice app for online classes ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‡
Ok
Very good experience on team
Nice app for metting
"I don't like it forces sound output as calling, which does not allow me to mute it completely. I wanna set it as media. This is inconvenient."
Good
Best app for study through school
"I like how you can text and talk but I have to do school work on it but so far, so good."
"For office purpose it's good one, having lots of advanced features. Why don't you try some public chat app like watsapp."
Great chatting app and the video app is a 4 out of 5 stars!
Alright I guess. Had to download it for school anyways
Works as expected. Some of the features are better on the phone app than desktop.
Good
Is very helpful for school but notebooks is not working
Works pretty good ðŸ‘
"It works well for quick meetings and conf calls. The security is ok but its a hassle especially for cvr accounts. I constantly have to login with password AND authenticator. On my phone that is time consuming. Also guests cant view files shared. If the account was set up with a civilian email, they are automatically guests and can not view any files shared by a cvr account."
"pretty decent app, still learning how to use it"
Sold for all my school work not much else
Es genial! DeberÃ­an agregar la opciÃ³n de poner fondo como en la versiÃ³n para escritorio
Good app
Easy to use and applicable
This app needs an update
Easy interface.
Good
Gets the whole office in one place and on one page.
"Very good and easy to learn, but you do have some lag and sound issues at times."
Easy to conect and replay
Satisfied
The only thing I don't like is Teams is resource heavy on mobile
nice learning app
Better on the computer as functionality is limited on mobile
User friendly Cool interface
It is a good app and a viable one too
Good
Love it
A must have.
Some things are not working but other than that it is good
So far so good!
Ok
Would be great if could set up channels with regular members who are outside or different to those in the wider team.
Pretty good app
It stop working after somedays and this goes everytime. Otherwise it is very nice app.
"It's good, needs a little work on the glitches but it's good"
"Works well, good fundamentals."
Good
Too many features but once you get the hang of it its useful really. I would have given 5 star but its difficult getting used to it.
Does what its supposed to
"Good working experience, its batter in using and sharing screen as well"
"For what I use it for it works great. It would be nice to chat yourself, since creating a self group just requires more steps to message yourself--but that's more a Teams issue than the app."
"Very convinient to use.The best part liked by me as I can set silent hours, i.e. weekends and off working hours I don't see message pop up on my screen. It would be great if call switch between Mobile app n desktop app is enabled. We have to drop call on one app to join the same bridge on another. Sometimes there is wifi issue so we would like join the same bridge from mobile that time switching isn't flawless."
"It is a very helpful app for education and official purposes but please kindly remove the ability of removing and muting a participant of the meeting of others in the meeting except the organizer of the meeting, because it is becoming so irritating, so kindly please remove"
Due to my beliefs I don't attend school but now that this app exist i have to go and i do not appreciate this. App works fine though
"Really nice app, though I did experience some troubles but it gets better when you get the hang of it ."
It is a good app just that I can't access recordings when I'm using the app on my phone. I wonder what the problem is.
"Functionality isn't were it needs to be in order to be super user friendly, but recent updates are somewhat pleasing."
Takes forever in Android
"That, grate app"
Quickly chat or video call with options
ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘
"Great app But there is some problems.. Like I can't reply to a message The text in Hebrew type left to right insted right to left When we gave control in share screen, there is some bugs (dealy, accuracy when switching control)"
Good
Cool
Its very good app but it difficult to take two different things like i am only able to take school class for my tution i have to install zoom but i can take both classes at zoom but for personal and for your buisness it is best app
User friendly app
I only wish the polly feature was still available in the meeting chatbox. It made it wayyy easier to use
Great experience so far
Good for meetings and calls :)
Very good experience with it
ðŸ‘Good
It is good aap but sometimes it doesn't respond
"It's a good app I use it for my online classes and it's very easy to use, but sometimes it's very glitchy and it's laggy but apart from that a very good app ðŸ‘"
"It's good but it crashes often, I get kick out from meetings"
i like this app
Works well enough. Limited vs the desktop app.
A lot of options ... Very useful apps. The only quirk is there's a bit of a learning curve to figure out the lingo and understand how everything integrates.
good experience so far
Various bugs and it requires a broad band width internet to run smoothly.....but its battery consumption is low.
It is a superb app but till yesterday it was difficult for me to upload the hw and the call gets automatically dropped even if I have full speed net this is only issue I face
Super
Working as expected. Sometimes it takes longer to open but not a deal breaker.
The background settings cannot be viewed even though my app is already updated.
The app is a bit leggy at some points and a bit difficult to understand but otherwise is great!!!
Great app. Still has some room to grow though.
It's a very nice video calling app or we can say that a very good calling app. I work from this app about 5 hours and I have no complaints about this. Very nice app.thats why I have given 4 ðŸŒŸ
This app is very good app for meeting but it can be more better
Excellent â˜º it's awesome ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
Ok

It was so cool using this app
"I have used this app just for two weaks. So far is OK. Just, mating subject overlaps mating date."
Good app

Memory consumption is too high. Try to make it lite app.
Great for work
"Very handy multi account option, unlike in Windows..."
It's look great app. Some confusion... hope I can sort it out
Good For online classes. Sometimes it crashes
Good
Superb app
Awesome App
Good app
This app helps me but i can not sigin in from my tab but i can from my laptop
Good
This app is very nice for online classes and all in this difficult condition it is very useful even it is very much better than zoom. But one thing was there that it takes very much network that's why I have given 4 stars. Accept that all things are nice in this app
Pls fix that bug In meeting chat pls....
Make learn very easy
Good
"Very fuctional, better than edmodo in almost everyway expect expect it isnt as user friendly"
When it works its great but it does seem to default for calls regardless of if i have it also working on my pc (and i thought id used tge settings to stop that)
"It's excellent online meeting application, need to have file transfer and all attendees should able to share screen at a time"
Rotation of screen should be provided for the meeting participants window also. It becomes easy and convenient to use that way. Whenever a meeting is created it creates two rooms automatically and the members are confused which room to enter. It's a big issue.
Super app to use
"Network problem is good ,good app for study"
Best
Nice to use
It's a very good app .To use this app you need particularly high speed internet connection.If the net is slow you won't be able to see the screen and stuff .Overall good
Good

"Hi, this app is very helpful and amazing. But I'm having issue while opening assignments, as it gives me error that ""Sorry we cannot take you to this destination at this time."" And I get this error in my all of the classes in teams. Could you please fix this issue. Thanks in advance!!"
This really is a great platform to work collaboratively. Especially during the lockdown.
Impressive environment
Great app
I love MS Team. But you need to find a way to shift the option and end call strip somewhere when presentations are taking place. Usually one wouldnt be able to see on the presentation where you hace option and end call thing.
"Good app overall, would be nice if the calendar could load further than a week"
Audio is clear!
"4 stars because I do believe that there's always a room for improvement but yeah, this is LEGIT !!! ðŸ‘Œ"
Amazing

"This is a good app overall. We can chat, create meetings, join meetings, call others and this app is best for school purposes. Because of the current pandemic we couldn't attend classes in school and in this app we can also interact with teachers and students."
Easy to use. Love the dark mode! ðŸ˜Ž
"It was a very good app before but then these few days I am noticing that every day it is showing teams isn't responding in the middle of the class at starting it is all fine the first few classes go just fine but after that it stops working please do something about this , I really need to attend my classes except that everything else is very good Thank you have a good day/night"
Better experience with ms teams.. very easy to access files but one problem I see in the app is that if we have a recorded video from a class or meeting we cannot access it as a guest. This is not feasible for everyone to get an account for the organization.
Nice app. But there is some technical glitches that occur when I open teams.pls fix that or else it is a good app for online class in this pandemic situation.....
I like this app but it is very hard to download. When I try it is there but it doesn't open.help.
"Pretty good platform for organising online meetings, quizzes, classes etc.Easy to use and smooth functioning."
It is a very good app. This is the app l am using for my online classes. But one thing is all are being recorded ðŸ¤–. That's too bad . It seperates everyone like attendees and presentees that's very cheap.
Yo
Nice appðŸ‘ðŸ˜‰ I like this app

"Very good app.... Only drawback is, it's taking memory more than 700 MB... Looks like heavy app"
amazingâ¤ï¸
Great
This used to be slow and unintuitive but it's gradually been improved over the last few months
Nice
Its a bit glitchy but awsome !!
Good . ðŸ˜Š
Nice app
Very good
Easy and fast.
Ok
Very good for corporates
it is a great app for online classes but chat is disabled
In meeting anyone can remove & mute anyone else..i think this is demerit for college & school teacher... beacuse anybody can mute or remove teacher from meeting
Good
Very valuable for my study but we shoud know it who is remove me this is the most problem
It's a good app. We were not able to log in first but after that it was easy .lt is easy to send and receive home works. So it's a nice app ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Nice update some new features also
"I like this app, but the only reason I am removing a star is that this gives us CLASSES! I hate classes, more like HELL"
Nice but while in the a meeting some problems will occure
Nice
I think there is a chances of improvement in Sound quality
Handy tool
"when This app used in mobile phone, all system is not work perfectly and hang or slow other app,"
It is a good app for online meetings Student can easily attend the class ....ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
Very good app
It was very nice ðŸ˜Š
Thia app is very helpfull and its security features are superb. The only thing is that the camera is not 100% perfect.
Very good
It's good for students like us . It is easy to use. But sometimes it becomes difficult to handle
This app helps in to create a meeting which my friends and I can attend to talk with them. So this app is really good. But the screen share option is not working properly. So please update the screen share option ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚.
I am planning to go to the meeting
Great app But can be better
I like this app.but needs more speed
Good app
Amazing but we don't get messegies on screen we have to go in chat box
This is a nice app.... But if u put changing background options in mobile phone also then it would be fantabolous ðŸ˜
So far so good... and it's for work purposes
"Used for team chat, during remote work, particularly in the time of covid. Very functional, but seems a little dated anymore. Lacks integration into our tools of choice, at my current employer, so the environment feels a little remote."
It's great
Has improved over the period. Happy that we can access using mobile phones
If copy-paste can be done from MS WORD to MS Teams it would have been nice ðŸ˜”
"It's not a slick as your regular messaging app, but it does the job. Needs some cross functionality built in with the rest of the Microsoft suite."
Efficient
hopes the desktop app to be as good as the mobile cause it crashes very often
"Although the app needs to mature a bit more before moving to primetime in work-related virtual environments, e.g. Citrix, it is rapidly gaining user buy in as an alternative to other similar solutions such as Zoom or Skype"
Overall it has worked great.
"Fairly easy to use. Some disruption but depends on the strength of your Internet connection. Great for college use, storing work on files and communicating with tutors"
Cool app
Good
Great
Easy to use and offers most of the functionality of the desktop program.
Bit confusing but okay :)
"Cool app, needed."
User friendly :)
Experience is decent app is getting better over time.
works on chrome good but it need to have like a background
Just still learning
"The MS TEAMS app is very useful for organising the school and college work, classes and calender. A good application in whole :)"
Need improvement
It is good but mean I have to do school workðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜¢
It goes slow some time
Great...
Great app
"It's a bit overwhelming, but it's improved a lot."
Very organized and maintains privacy as well
Need to be able to drag and drop files from computer to chat instantaneously.
Good for education
Good
I am still in the trying some features in the app but i enjoy this experience.
use it for school work
Useful for connecting with teammates
good app
Beautiful and good app but I don't see whiteboard when anyone share it on their screen please fix it
Nice app ðŸ‘ It really works good but takes a lot of net
Nice app
"An easy way to have a chat with teammates, share pictures, share screen, calendar update: the app is consuming a lot of resources, when I change between chats get freeze"
It is very useful
Excellent
"It works ok for my daughter's online learning, but we don't seem to have all the options, like Hand Up or Backgrounds. How come we don't all have these?"
Sometime I can't upload images from my phone to send to my teachers and my assignments do not load at times
Yes its useful to have your team whenever they need you. I just feel the samsung and microsoft product don't like each other. I have found 1 fix for the battery issue. In dev mode i set the phone to don't keep activities. Yes you don't get notification but you battery lasts and you can use the app when you want and then the app is great to use. Note 10 plus losing 40% battery a day from app.
Great app
Love it but there is one problem When I try to send videos It always tells me upload Failed
Works good enough
Cool
Nice
It's good for school apps easy to use
Great
The ability to work with all Team Members
Its a great app for schools
Better for future generations
"Video conferencing and document collaboration is first class, remote control is getting there."
Just give some controls of the meeting to attendies
"I was using this app from last 2 monthswith my college account. I have cleared my app data tody. Now I am trying to log in with the account given by my college but the app says ""you no longer have access to this org"" Or "" Microsoft teams isn't enabled for your organization """
This is a good app with good video quality during online learning although it doesnt a constant good connection as it lags ne out of the app and crashes this is not my net fault as it happened to other users too but you can depend on this app as it is great for communication.
"Very easy to navigate, awesome emojis and overall a great experience. ðŸ˜€"
It's great but my only issue is that I can't copy a message
Some bugs here and there but actually a very intuitive layout
Decent app
Why can't I chat in chating box of a meeting? Why can't I access the recorded meetings on my tablet? You need to fix that
"Yeah it's a great app,better than any other meeting app!!ðŸ‘Œ"
"Great combination of an efficiency, broad communication platform, and video conferencing tool. There are a few needed navigational tweaks and functionalities missing - however, given the accelerated timeframe the MS Teams team had to roll this out under, very impressive."
This app is kind of good but its more developing in the video calling department
Nice appðŸ˜Š but some improvements in call and meetings were needed . Although it's good
"Aside from a few glitches here and there, the app works quite well."
Its a bit slow. I believe that's because of the type of interface this has. Can be made further lighter.
This is the best app but without earphone the voice is is not clear..
Learn more evryday
This app is simply awesome as its audio and video quality in video calls is simply awesome but it is faster in phone more than the pc
"I love this app,but sometimes this app does not give me notifications,and sometimes the meeting and shared screen will not have clarity. All others are perfectâœ”ï¸"
Good app.
Good
This ap is wonderful. Voice and video clearity is good. But some time it stop notifying for new msg or cal please resolve this
Nice job.. better..but not too fast..on desktop...
"Good.easy for communication, though interrupted often by poor connectivity"
Very useful app
"This is the apps that I use the most during covid-19. But please let us record the whiteboard. Because i'm in college, i use whiteboard feature a lot."
The Teams app helps a lot when one needs to communicate with other people who have access to the app. I also use it for training purposes.
Its proper gets the things done
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
On parallel with zoom or even better for collaborative work. Really impressed with stability and cross platform support.
A bit soft.
App works through wifi.
"The teams video call is the worst, it always has buzzing sound. I can't hear what my teammates said. But about the groups and chats, it is really good. Hope he teams workers can fix the calling thing. Keep up the great work â™¥ï¸"
"I use this for work, to deliver lectures using it on my desktop and mobile, handy to keep students engaged."
The meeting cannot be downloaded in the mobile phones
No time limits
"This is a very good app which I use for my virtual classes. But only one problem sometimes occurs that there is a poor network connection and the voice of our teachers are also not audible/cracks or echoes a lot. One feature more should have been there that the message section during any active meeting. This is a very requested feature from all of my classmates and me. Overall, the app is very good and please try to pay attention to my review and do something for the issues."
The best App for huge teams.
Very good
Good app But problem is of connection
"It's the best application out there for meetings and stuff. The interface looks solid after the recent update. However, that one android feature which I'm yearning for is the ""BACKGROUNDS option"". It's there in the desktop version, but not in the android one. I'd love that to be here too."
Good
I like this app very much but there is a one think I don't like . That is need some background image in android mobile also
It's ok. Still figuring it out. No issues till now

"After a while the mobile app stops getting updates (chats, call or any notification), I have to put on my pc to get updates. Useless app."
Nice meeting app with nice interface should deserve 5 stars but has some internet connection and mic issues otherwise over all app is very nice.
Nice application but please add background feature for mobile users too
Good app but sometimes it crashes which is very annoying and frustrating.

In meeting there is a option called kick someone out . So anyone can kick anyone without permission so this option only teacher should possess

"That was amazing , I was waiting for my PC so that I can do in that and change my background , but one function should be there that you can see your password , but it was good , after all I gave this app 4 ðŸŒŸ"
It's really good but confusing at the same time.
Very good specifically the different forums that can be customised

"Please fix the push notification. When I tap the push notification app in not launching all the times. This is the basic feature and most of the apps are working fine including Outlook. Not sure why in Teams, tapping the push notification doesn't launch the app. May be, Teams developer team can internally connect with Outlook Android app team to fix the push notification issues."
Superb app
"I give it 4 stars because the application is very slow to open and in the rest they will improve that, I add one more star"
Nice but little adjustments needed otherwise it's better than other apps.
I t is a great app you can paste links video calls and texting this will be useful.I gave 4 stars because there were many glitches
Great app. It helped me with my online classes and tests..
Best
Excellent app for our meetings.
"Using for university classes, helps keep us connected during these challenging times. The connection is occasionally bad but I assume its more on the university's WiFi quality. Overall a decent experience!"
Nice i like it
There are some lags but this app is super cool and u should try it. U can communicate with other friends or relatives 4 stars for u teams
Nise app
"App is very good for students studies. But I have given 4 stars because you should do an update that if a child is muting or making someone attendee or presenter, then the other child will know who is making him or her attender /presenter or muting. And you should make this update"
It's help me lot in my study.

Some video calls have problems like as echo
Great experience so far.
Works seamlessly with Teams desktop version. Almost perfect.
Great for work
ok
The app is very helpful but u can do better
Very functional. A bit difficult getting use to.
"It's a great app, I use it for online school and it is very good but there is just a little thing that happens a lot and that is that sometime when I want to send my teacher homework it refuses to send but other that that it is good"
Excellent!
Great meeting platform
It's good using that day by day..
Excellent app for meetings. I personally receive classes online and with this app its really easy. The only problem it's when star a download you can see the progress until finished completely.
Good
Great mobile experience and responsive interface
See look here I like the app but I like it better on the laptop because you can do more stuff download it on the laptop not phone! ðŸ¤£
Efficient
"Very powerful collaboration tool, quite a lot to take in and get used to using."
Great so far!
It's good overall but sometimes it decides that it's not going to send push messages when I get messages away from the computer which is annoying.
Really handy when away from the computer. Works seemlessly
Informative
Would be even better if there was an option to view all asignments at once
Excellent
Great
Sometimes it will take too much time to show the status of the person.
"Pretty good for connecting with colleagues, especially the chat and call features"
Good app not so much but bcz it take time to password
Its good ðŸ‘
Nyc for communication
Unable to screensharing for Dual monitor.
"Consumes a lot of data, very complicated app, connection discards often"
It's a great app. I like the fact that it stores conversational and written data. You can store videos for a meeting etc.
It is a pretty good app but once i was opening the files on any of of the channel but just when i clicked files after 3 secs the page was saying that share stuff in this channel Plz fix this
Needs an function to catch grammar and spelling errors.
These days m facing problems while sharing my screen. M unable to fix it nir m I able to share the screen.
Great experience
It's really good learn.. But i couldn't see all the members of the meeting for my wish..for mee it's not at all seems good
Great app for school
Great
Very Good + Useful
Teams is super great i have my school meetings and chat to my classmates but why i gave 4 stars is that when i join a call on my big tablet it lags so much that i can't even move the screen other then that this app is great
Good and very organized
Good
I don't know
"I have my beef with Teams, but as far as the app goes, it is pretty good. Easy access to chat and files, etc."
Always it was good. But not giving permission now
Good
Better then expected....
Super helpful. Easy to use.
Good app
Great companion to the desktop application.
Good
Plz plz improve this app
"All things are good But main problem is during meeting (online lectures) if someone remove us we don't know who is removing the participants please into this issue do the needful because, sometimes very important topic is running but at same time if someone removed you it will Create more trouble."
It's a great experience and I am learning new things
Works
Very easy to use it's a shame the settings don't sync between desktop and app
This is a very good app.....Every one should try it...!!!! But one thing the video is not clear sometimes
i think it awsomeeeeee
"I like the app..it's good..but in android versions we can't get background effect or even blur....it would be good if we could get....developer, please do this!!"
Works great.
Only broken feature is cross domain messaging
"Two points to consider: 1) On mobile, available shall be shown only when we open the app. 2) It is better if the status on mobile is separated from PC and prioritized."
Rl
It's good going but few things should have been there like complete deletion of channels. Tagging of channels from Flow. CI tools integrations etc
"The Teams environment takes some getting used to, but worth the effort once you get comfortable with it."
"Well overall I would like to explain that the app is very versatile in its usage and obviously for this reason it mostly serves its purpose of efficient communication. Some optimizations though I would agree need to come to the streaming part of face timing and personally, they should adopt the format of face timing that zoom uses, since zoom is even more proficient and adaptable. That's about it."
"The app is better than the school desktop version. TEAMS has great ideas, but I think it needs to be more streamlined for education. It seemed to work well for adults. Hopefully it will continue to evolve for K12 Education, especially at the Early Childhood Elementary level."
Good. Need to test system with video on for large number of participants
It's good for talking to people
This is a nice app. I attend all my online lectures on it but I am not able to change the background.
It is good
"Everything is good in this app, instead of some features like virtual background effect. It is only available in mac & windows"
A bit lag
Good but not excellent
Nice overall. But call quality is not that good
Useful tool for team meetings and project calls
Happy with it
Great. Secure. Easy to use.
Key tool to allow remote meetings. Easy to use.

"Consuming more internet(Quality of meeting video is poor), Require's optional updates more."
Good app
Yes good but thought I needed and it was just a number.
"Excellent sound clarity, easy and fun to use, plenty of handy features that make conferencing and communicating to groups a walk in the park...only minor issue is that it doesn't bug you with notifications, i.e. you have to remember your meetings/conferences schedule, not for the serious absent minded individual"
Its brilliant all I can say
its so good its a little harder than zoom but when you understand it its pretty cool i take my online secission in her i am in grade 6 by the way but its actually good it may take awhile until you figure it out and to sign in
Ok
"I loved the app and used it everyday for work. Since the update the app constantly crashes and freezes up my phone, a Galaxy S9. I'm bummed because my work runs on Teams, and it's been great to be able to access everything from my phone--Shifts, chat, meetings, channels. Any solutions? Update: Oct. 1, 2020 the app is back and working well. I use it all the time to check staff shifts, participate in meetings and reply to chat questions. Fantastic!"

This app is best video calling app. But has some glitches. 1. I did not get option for virtual background not on pc or even not on phone. 2. Assignment notification cannot redirect you to assignment page. 3. It takes a lot time to respond in many cases. 4. It has no notifications for posts in teams. But but but these glitches cannot make this app bad. Once fixed these glitches app will deserve more stars than playstore provides.
