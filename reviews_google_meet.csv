There is a problem . In this app Sometime it shows failed to join meeting.
It is very very disappointing app yesterday some hacker comes in our lec and disturb us so i kindly request you to upgrade the app privacy so no hacker can come inside

"This app is not good because data consume very and video quality, sounds are bad"
im having a hard time on installing it
Won't even download
I have an issue of a mic in google meet application. It's a real shame that google's own google meet application has an issue of the mic on their own android one certified device(Nokia 6.1 and Nokia 8.1) whereas all other manufacturers custom os phones are working fine. I have to minimise google meet application only then my voice got detect by an application.
Yor app is FREAKEN dumb
I hate school
Bakwas app
"The new version is just bad. I mean, in the previous version, everything was accessible with from the main meeting screen... All the participants names along with options to pin, chat options, etc.. now, it's behind layers. I have to open up a different menu for chat, and a different menu to pin up participants. So annoying."
"Just downloaded yesterday and app crashes as soon as you open it. Need this for my online classes, so it's frustrating to say the least."
Zoom is much better but google is always keep it above in recommendations. That's unethical.

"We need a way to access meetings as ""guest""s: every time someone from a G Suite organization invites me to a meeting, I have to use my personal Google account which isn't very professional. I cannot join using phone calls using the app either. Also, there is no real PC support with native apps and the web app is insanely sluggish with VERY unreliable microphone support with Chrome."
I hate the new version of appðŸ˜– it's difficult to use meet in phone. The new version is very disturbing and it's hard to chart and see the video together and can't see other people like before. Hopw you bring back the old version.
Very bad app . I hate it. It ruined my life from online classes and teacher. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
Most worst
It keeps crashing and doesn't even start on OnePlus 7T. I tried everything but no luck.

Nueva actualizacion horrible... El chat no se actualiza si uno esta en el y No puedo ver la presentacion y el chat a la vez. Dificulta mucho la accion rapida que se podia hacer con el diseÃ±o simplistico de antes
I dont want to be on till 11:30
This app was perfect until this new update. It irritates me the was its set up now. The old version was way better

"Worst app ever seen.. the new update is Trash and nothing...Too many bugs and glitches,most poor Ui. mic always turned off due to size of callðŸ˜¡"
I give the app only one star because in that app the presentation is not to see clearly and the app only for study because the students faces are not to see in big squre in that big scure only teacher's face is see in big scure that's why I give up their one star
My google meet has a different interface. It is on a dark mode and I can't bring it back to the default google meet.

"I use meet for attending my online class. Meet is was the best video call app until the new update. It is so bad,i cant even see the person because of my small phone because the call screen wont fit the phone screen and you cant even see the person because of the big buttons and the small screen. This is so ANNOYING! I would rate the old meet 5 stars and the new update less than 0 stars. Please give me the old update or atlest make the buttons smaller and the screen bigger. I missed many classes"
This app is good...but whenever I am joining through my mbl data...my mbl data is getting switched off automatically and I am not able to use this app with my mbl data.it is working only with wifi . It is not working even I restarted my mbl and I cleared my apps cache and storage also...but still it is not working
The consumption of data is too much in less time this needs to be given attention as many students are using this app for their education purpose and they are unable to attend all of the lectures conducted in a day because it the consumption reach to its highest usage limit .
It is ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®it is a west app thu
Good for study...â¤
This app is not at all good for meetings or classes as it consumes alot of data . It takes minimum 1GB of data for a sesssion of 1 hour which is ridiculous! I wont suggest you google meet for session Do not download it !
Consume 500 MB of data or more than that forjust 1 hr....new update is not that expectedly good....but after that more problems are raising...
"I don't like the recent update with gmail it is the worst and full screen doesn't appear, also there is problem with chat session. If you have network problem the app misbehaves very wierd you can't see anything only voice is heard. Also it consumes a lot of data"
"It uses a lot of data... Due to pandemic I have to attend online classes through my mobile data , which really doesn't work out. Also the updated feature gives no access to full screen Please fix this."
It uses very large amount of data for one meeting. Very large
I like this app but the only problem is that I can't do meetings in my phone whose android version is 4.4.2 .. if the developer can make this app available on android version 4.4.2 then I will only be the one who downloaded this app in all over my family. I request to the developer to make this app available on android version 4.4.2.. this is my humble request....
I don't like the new update. Please change this ..... We want old one.
"the new update looks bad, i can't watch a meeting with the chat open, and i get scared everytime because i think my mic was open. i wish i could go back to an older vers. of this"
Very worst app I ever seen
Very bad app ..... in my opinion it can't well used by the student because of its poor performance.
The app is so slow and service is very bad.
"I used this app but 3 times it's disconnected and also I can not see all the other students in one page the same time,just if they speak I can see them and after that very soon disappear."
latest update is very bad kindly restore previous one.... its too hard to understand
Guys don't download this app. This app is very worst app. I am using this app since from the month of June. But from June till October no improvement I am seeing in this app. Only they want 5 star rating on every meetings over.

This is a good app but in past some days i am facing an issue of audio and presentation .some time the audio was breaking and the voice was also delaying . This app really uses a lot of battery and data also. So its my suggestion to google to improve the app.
It consumed my 750 mb net but despite that the video is not clear and the audio is delaying. If i can i shall rate it negative. Worst app from google. New update is worst.

Lots of problems are there
"The new ui is utter garbage. I had a much more enjoyable time using the old white ui. This darker one is easier for the eyes but is garbage. Its so inconvenient, the things that i used to be able to do with the old one doesn't work anymore. I have to pin people to see if their cam is on rather then just having to tap on them. Sometimes when i teacher is presenting the presentation just disappears and i can't see it anymore. Please google I'm begging you change it back its utter cancer"

I think Google is ignoring the fact that Meet needs a serious update..I prefered Meet on Other applications but.. I was wrong!! It runs Smoothly No issues with quality. but it misses some features that are mandatory. There are number of reasons that makes other applications powerful. And no reason to prefer Meet. Sorry to say I m disappointed!ðŸ˜”
The new version is bug. Cant connect on my online class. Why?? Please do anything.
I want the old version. Because this version is not so helpful

Many changes are needed . The developer should work hard to improve it as it drains 1.5 GB data for a 3 hours class and consumes almost 80 to 90% battery in 3 hours and our phones also gets heated . Developer should look after all the above nessesary changes to improve the demand of Google Meet in market .
I updated this app but still the voice output is very high. I checked my phone but the problem is with the app. Please make available Original Sound system a it is in in Zoom meetings.

Worst update
"The worst app I've ever used till now... The audio and video were delayed and not in sync. The presentation was not at all clear, also the host has no control over the presentation anyone in between starts the presentation and main view goes off. I automatically exit the meeting & a remarks box appears on the screen. Even I can't send the massage in the chat box as the people joining and leaving the meeting massage regularly pops on it.

"Edit: I really appreciate for the reply and suggestion. I have checked the 2 links that you mentioned, unfortunately I can't find the solution yet. I must say that this ""meet"" app was not system app or pre-installed app (As far as I know) in my phone. The problem is, this app just appeared out of nowhere (I have uninstalled it), and I'm sure that me or someone else didn't install it because I'm the only one that have the access. So, how can I prevent this problem from happening again?"

"The most horrible app in my whole life. It doesn't tell you wether your are keeping your camera or speaker is on or not. It doesn't even tell you wether do you want to exit the meeting or not when you tap the home button, I mean if your hand mistakenly hits the home button during an important class or meeting you just directly go out of the meeting, at least show a pop-up to wether do you want to exit. It also just throws you out of the meeting when the network has even a little bit of problem."
Very bad app

"This app is good but lacks in many ways. My school is conducting exams on this app and it hangs many times. I lost a full 30 minutes out of 1.5 hours just because of this... This sucks. Not only this, many times the screenshare is not visible. Like seriously. Even my friends who use laptop suffer from the same problem. Just fix it ASAP.

Re mala
I can't do anything! I have great wifi and it says I can't create or join any meetings! I haven't been able to see my friend for a while and I thought this was the app that would connect us again! But it wasn't. I could only join one meeting and then it stopped working.
Why you kick me out from Meeting when i one click on back button. Also present screen showing in half screen. Please fix. And improve user interface . Otherwise I'll give you 5 star.

This app is nice but when people start coming or leaving i can't see my chat box. When my network is good it still says that 'failed joining'. I am annoyed sometimes i get late to get join. And my worst problem is the Google meet has changed i don't know why but my Google meet version as change it looks like zoom app. Google LLC i request u to fix this problem. If there would be an option to give 0 stars i would give. Fix the problem. And i hope that i will not face this kinds of problem again.

"Since the update, when I (android phone) click on a Meet invitation, Firefox starts up and goes to Google play store, and tells me Meet is installed. Nothing else happens. I uninstalled it, restarted, and clicked on the invitation again. It said it would install soon, which it did eventually. When I clicked on the invite again, the same thing happened. On my wife's phone clicking on the invite works fine, BUT I can't watch the video full screen anymore, when I cast the meeting to my TV, the resulting image is small due to not being able to rotate or maximize the video. What has been continually annoying, is that the audio cannot be cast to the TV. I understand why, but it should be an option, since both are GOOGLE apps!"

"Please add CALL HISTORY feature in the app. We are supposed to manually enter the meeting code every time and that's very annoying. So please add CALL HISTORY feature in the app. This meeting app is nowhere close to zoom.

The layout of the app has become so poor due to the latest update company has pushed feels like not to attend classes . Notifications of others irritates me a lot at the time of typing . This app does not even deserves 1 star ðŸŒŸ . Better go with zoom application .
No load balancing.. Chat Box freezed for a meeting of 170+ ðŸ˜‚ Whatsapp Chat Box is much better than This ðŸ˜œðŸ¤ª
Such a worse app
Please ban this irritating appðŸ¥º It is just waste of time please modi ji ban this app to.......ðŸ™ðŸ¥º
Say another thing about this plz
To much noise
Best for teachers. Nightmare for students.
"This application keeps on asking to rate it in between my Examination. Everytime it asks video conference shuts down automatically. Whether I rate or cancel it keeps asking again and again. I even turned off the notification things that they ask for improving the app, in meet settings. It wasted so much time during my examination and resulted loss of marks. My paper could have been cancelled too. I have sent them feedback on meet app and asked them about this issue. But there is no response."
This app is not good at all please don't download this app.. Zoom is better than this app..
It is too bad cause I want to attend lec but after giving rating suddenly the rating opt comes back because of that option my lec leave on one's own after that when I rejoin its start presenting my screen which make disturbance for others students and teachers don't allow me to attend lec after operating meet it makes difficult to attend lec

"I think this is the worst app ever made by Google,it's updated version is very bad, my experience with this app becomes worst day by day Don't waste your time installing it."
Google meet your meeting app is almost useless because you don't give the recording option for ordinary people who don't have G Suite administration . Solve my issue by providing me free G Suite administration if you don't give I think that you are a beggar
"Audio,video all is pathatic"
The video was breaking and voice was breaking
"I am not able to join meetings. Event though I've updated the app and there is no network issue it shows ""failed to join meeting"" . I can't attend my classes because of this problem."

Please improve your service. This a second time I given 1 rating this app . My all academic classes conducted in this app . Whenever i join the meeting sometime i am atomatic left tha meeting.
worst app ever
I want zoom app In this app I can't servive
Is not good joining failed please update
There are many problem in this app my phone is hanging When I am in the class then the screen was disturbing
This app is very irritating
I hate this app bcz after rejoining a meeting i can't hear anything and by automaticly i'll left the meeting. Google want to remove these kind of freaking bugs from this flipping app. Google meet want the feature to chat privately. Even zoom is better than this trucking software Dude my connection speed is 100mbps. Do i need 1gbps to run this poop software.
It's a wonderful app
very dissappointed. our voice is delayed and repeated after a minute. very worst
Ye app banane wala pagal hai kaisa ghatiya app banaya hai bar bar ausio video presentation break hoti hai this app is a fake app

Why you have made this app
"And when is it going to start ? Reinstalled, still the matter doesn't change. While other apps such as 'classroom' are running fine, the meet isn't even opening. Please fix the problems as i have missed the scheduled classes and other classes are soon to start. Btw, it was running fine few days back but it's Gone. And for your kind information I even cleared my cache and restarted my phone, these things are not the matter . It's a real problem. - user"
It is the worst app. The notification always came and I can not send the messages and also not able to see what I am writing .I never suggest to anyone to use this app. It presentation is not good Plz bring meetings Recording option while meeting. But it is the very very very worst meeting app in the world. If you will bring meetings Recording option in this app......
It is very bad. Becoz when i got link to join and i joined it was same like old update. Nothing is changed. Its very bad update.
"The worst app ever I faced In my life ,i get problem regarding to joining it,I have done all the things that your team has told me but nothing happened .I still get the problem the problem started from your new layout/update which is not given to every phone"
"Says ""You cant join video call while you are on a phone call"" But I am not talking on phone And after uninstalling and reinstalling this app thrice and clearing data no issue is being solved really disappointed with this app I am not able to join my classes no support is there . I don't know what to do with thisðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
Amazing for meetingsðŸ‘
Waste
"I'm not able join meetings, it says failed to join, also I have not recieved the update,"

Too slow
Jayakrushana palai
"Iam not able to any meeting, cause:When my data is on, when I open this app my turns off. And when I was in the meeting suddenly it off itself."
It is difficult to search person's chat. So bad
During meeting it got a white screen it's happen more than a single time in a meeting . request to fix it
It not install
It's not very good app because sometime connecting or sometime not connecting
This creates too much problem like audio and video. And also the screen is too shot to see and there is no option to do a private chat like zoom. In meeting some we have some doubt which we cannot share to other personally we have to out in publicly. So I think if there a option to do a private chat it will be much better. Please check this problems. Thanking you.
Could've been a lot better than this.. They Really need to work on this app otherwise it won't be good for Google.. With or without microphone there's no exchange of voices.. You're supposed to communicate through messages which leads to several problems.. It's especially hard when you're preparing for a competitive exam and something like this happens....
Update is not good.. previous version was simple and easy to use
Google meet loaded to my phone and not my tablet. The Tablet is not an option. I really hear Google
"Worst application ever I used in my life. Now my online class is going through google meet. So I am forced to use this,when I open this app,my internet connection will be disabled. And now I am using Google meet through Gmail. Still it is there and now I can't use through Gmail too. I know how to use Google meet in it's app and Gmail. But I am unable to connect to a meeting. It is happening only when I am using my Airtel mobile data. Now it's working,so I will update review on Monday 28-9-2020"
Ok.............
Padhi ke liye best aap
App does not work
"It keeps giving trouble both with audio and video throughout my class, I suggest fixing it so that my classmates and me wouldn't have to struggle to and frustrate to enjoy class"
This app automatically installed itself on my device. I don't know why? I don't use it. I just deleted it.

Ye acha app hai for study par ye bohot data kahata hai isliye mene ise 1 star rate kiya hai agar me ye app ko 5 star rate karu to 1st Of all ye app data kam khayega tab hi mein ise 5 star se rate karunga
Very bad.
"Google Meet kills my mobile network. Every time I try to join a meeting, my mobile network fails. Half the time, Meet times out before the network recovers, and I can't join the meeting. When I can join, the mobile network periodically dies. I've troubleshot through Sprint, and no issues were found with Sprint. This issue only happens with Meet. Zoom and Teams both function. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S20 G5 with all current updates. I tried the troubleshooting tips, they didn't work. Still broken."
It is.not working in micromax canvas 6 because able to join meet please solve this problem
Google meet is not recording internal audio for android 9 version while screen recording. First fix this problem.
Bad app
No provision of scheduling meetings. Wow does this app lack functionality!!
I think this app not working good because the audio and video isn't clear again and again it was left from the meeting this is very irritating for me finally this app is worst according to me only

"Very bad service the voice breaks, the video blurrs, the presentation are blurred It create many problem"
Can't do chat personally with anyone There is only one chatbox for all very disgusting
It is the best app among all other video conferencing app( mainly for education purpose) in my experiences if THE FULL SCREEN MOOD(non landscape) available....
"I am using this app for one month but suddenly from two days I am unable to join a meeting and if I join meeting it suddenly stops within a minute. I tried again to join and I am joined but it failed again and again within a minute . I have no network problem . So,why this is happening ?? Please fix this issue.It is not helpful. I am facing the same problem."

Your app is not working from network problem
"They MUST not limit the time of joining in . If the user applies for joining a meeting to the host . Then , the request must be kept pending until the HOST allows to enter meeting . Because many times the request expires (TIME OUT occurs) and the user have to request again and again..."
"I am unable to join any meeting Please help me ,,,,,,,"

Last two three days on words I am not able to join the meeting. when I get to joining the meeting I am getting the error meeting joining is failed like that only. What can I do.
Very worst app when i join a meeting just after joining it says unfortunately meet has stopped
With code meetings it's show failed to join
Not opening application even after trying for several times at the time of meeting sonetimes
Worst app.
The audio was breaking up
It is not responding immediately. There no sign before disconnecting due to poor network connection. Microsoft teams is better than this. Previous interface is far better than this new update. Need it to improve the interface.

It's good to communicate with my friends and relatives. I thank to Google meet.Some times it was strucking and becomes slow whether data is full.
meet boring i heat meet
This is good beacause they have a privacy but sometimesðŸ¤”
Pls add video mirroring in the setting.
Can't see when someone shared this screen in the new update
Its a good app but new version is too confusing ..
I am giving 2 starss because.. The old version was very cool.. Nd good to use but now the new version is not good.. Its not easy to see everyone in this nd take classes properly as a teacher . Thanks
In presentation I can not able to share video voice from my phone it's such bad thing I don't have laptop to do this what I do ?
"What's the wrong with this app.. video call can't be running after 15 minutes!! Is this pay less or getting charges now!???? I'm confused,can someone suggest"
The new update is just awful. I have to toggle between the video and the chat and that's very inconvenient.
"Last updated is not good, Old interface was nice. Can you please share a link from where I can download previous version??"
Having last update I have facing so many problems to join in a meeting with a link or using the meeting code ... For this I can't able to getting my school class .so you should look into this matter ....
Bad app
"Recently it's having some issues. Most of the times the voice breaks, the audio is delayed, the audio is echoed and if the video is turned on then it crashes, takes a lot of time to join the meeting. Also worse than Zoom. It shows that I am in the meeting but I can't hear others. Though other apps work well and I have a strong connection."
"La Ãºltima actualizaciÃ³n tiene muchas trabas. El inbox estÃ¡ escondido, es muy fastidioso"
"New update is not satisfying. Full screen mode is not available, chat box is not available on one screen and participants cannot be seen on one screen"
Google meet is nice but it continues taking me out so i will only give 2 stars
"I don't why when I am in class it's automatically logging out and saying ""Timed out to join meeting"". Please solve this issue"
Since the latest update my mic automatically mutes itself from the beginning it's a lot inconvenient in online classes please figure this out I can't fix that problem no problem from my side as some others are also facing same problem ðŸ™
Worst
"It's very use full but nowadays am facing some issues , so kindly playing check"
It has no option to blur the background
Please delete this latest update
Not good
Very blur
Goolge meet for android is not solid. That when you are in meeting and press a back button then you'll leave the meeting. Meet should have a pop up window.
In my new redmi note 8 pro phone i am facing a problem in google meet i couldn't see a host screen. I can see but for 1 minutes only otherwise i couldn't see host screen and when i am leaved the meeting the aap tell me again and again that rate this aap i have rate so many times sometime 1 star and some time 5 star and then also the aap is asking for to rate this aap
The problem is we can split the screer. When our teachers say to split the screen and write test
Best app

Very worst app ever seen
"i have good internet connection. But, everytime i'm trying to get into meeting , it says"" failed to join"""
After I updated the app it is not working properly please rectify every problem so that we can do our online classes properly
It would be better if there a filter.
"Terrible..! :( Downloads toooooo....slow! :( App good but, doenloads toooooo..slow It took 42.3 minutes to download! My Wi-Fi connection is good. Other apps downloads in a limited time..but, What's with this app? Needs a biggg.... Update ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤"
Everything is good just 2 problem. 1. Can't add multiple host. 2. Can't stop people to show their video or screenshare.
A lot of problems here....all time voice is breaking down...it's really irritating for me ... I don't give any good rating
Excellent app

We are not able to type in the chatbox If someone is joining or leaving from the meeting... If someone joins or leaves then we get a notification on the chatbox and we are unable to type during that.. Becuase of this I lost my attendence many times.. So please consider this and solve my issue... Then I will give 5star as there are no other minus points other than this...
It is good app but I have many problems audio was breaking up and many periods video was white and blur .
When i download it so very inconvinient
It is good but so much net will over while seeing online class and Phone is heating very much. It is not much good app

It is good app for online classes but when it comes to design it is very uncomfortable.
"For the earlier version it worked very smoothly But now after the update it's started giving trouble Like - no voice during call Blur video Voice cracks a lot Also , joining problems I hope that you may look to my problems and resolve it"
Superb
video hang while on activities
The older version was very very very good but the latest version is so dullðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”.
Two stars only because it's lagy all the time I have classes and my teacher gets mad and it says error acoured on it but yeah it's fine
Not clear voice
Nice
It is not connected with Bluetooth speaker. In the app also there is no option of bluetooth when speaker is connected with my phone. I am facing problem regarding these. It became very inconvenient for me to do class in Google meet now. Please fixed this so that every device get connected through bluetooth.
Battery drains fast
Happy
Not good not too bad!

"This app is good, but many a times when i use it in pc it doesn't work properly , it has problem in audio, i am using it for my online classes and i can't hear anything sometimes , please fix it , i am not able to hear anything. Please help me"
Before update it is good but now it is not comfortable with new update
"I have a problem , How I record the meeting as a participant ."
Today is problem in many we change 2 link
there is not a option of personal message for participants
It is nice app for students.but some times it will automatically left from the app.and nothing can here.
"This app is not enough good. As I am using this app by 1 month, and audio and video quality is not at satisfaction. And when we press back button it directly ends all our running meeting. There is no option for viewing all the participants simultaneously. There is no option to make sure that while we are joing a meeting our audio and video is off. And I hope Developer will fix this problem."
Thik he.
It's calendar is not working properly
"Hi, this is zehra Google meet is absolutely a very nice aap but after updating it when ever I try to join a meet it always shows "" fail to join ""or ""time out ""even if I'm on time.... I even don't have a internet issue I reinstalled the aap, restarted my phone but it didn't work."
Nyc
Plz add some features like personal chats Otherwise app 100% good
This app do study system easy
The second version of the meet is not WHAT I expect because sometimes it can be very miserable. Automatically audio is not perfect of my teacher... I can not understand that what my teacher is speaking... Also the camera is not working properly... The first version of Google meet was better. My phone gets hang by using it pls fix the buges... Also it is very hard to use the second version... Pls fix it...
The app was good but after the update the whole interface changed and became hard to use. The old interface was better than the new one. Please make an option to change into the old interface. Edit:Thanks for the response but the new UI doesn't really help. The old UI was was pretty easy to use.
Very bad app second day of the characters was not very good
Google team is very careless. From last few days I have been writing reviews and feedbacks but no one is replying me. I request you again to please provide the facility to join google meet meeting with Gmail. But my sister is an android user and she is getting this feature.
Good
Not bad
Old version is so good than new version because old version is more easier to drive than new version.
"Was free, but took advantage of the pandemic, since students are now adjusting to online classes. How low. ðŸ¤® Business is business, huh? ðŸ‘Ž"
"I kept getting kick because of the interview about the audio I can rejoin but it keeps kicking me off the meet (happens very frequently) I suggest to put a settings and add a ""enable user surveys"" button so that we could turn off surveys Thats all the problem I see in this app. I will rate this app higher if the problem is fixed"
Its not supporting in my phone . I want to join my online class but its not supporting this app make autocut from the class. Please improve this
"why i cant join a meeting using my student email, always ""failed to join a meeting"""
(â—â™¡âˆ€â™¡)
"Buttons Moved The button order is different than the online application. I tried unmuting myself and ended up hanging up by mistake. There should be consistency between the mobile and online versions. Also, viewing the chat is harder with the new update. It'd be nice to also have a feature that blocks the sound from the speaker from coming through on the mic to avoid echos/feedback."
Hello I can't access the meet on my phone home screen why?Huawei y 6 p
"My video does not turn on when i use my laptop but turns on when i use my phone and the mic too stops working in the middle of meetings. the laptop is old, so how do I fix this problem. Please fix this issue or help me fix it, i have examinations going on and i need to keep my video on throughout, hence it is really difficult for me to manage."
Attending meetings with this app really heats up my phone samsung s9+. You guys really need to do something here. My phone does not get this hot even while playing high end games.
This is good
It's not clear audio
"When I click my meeting link, my network turns off automatically.. This is the major problem for me."
In middle of the mu online classes asking ratings that what thing was I do t like it so please don't put like that and the app is super for my online classes

"I'm not able to share my video with audio. Please fix present screen section, so I would able to present screen with system sound."
"If in this android app has one more option to connect dslr to go live in webiner in android as well as ios, that would be more powerful for all users. One app is doing it to go live in youtube and all. Name of that app is camerafilive app. So if you will keep that option in this webiner, that will be more fruitful for all of us."
Wherever we present it from mobile any video the the voice dosen't come to others. & in laptop as there is a option (present with chrome tab) mobiles also should have this option
Can't get inside any meetings.

This app is great but there isn't many function and it didn't record and can't see who join when we present to meeting

"In my other devices it is displaying that '""your device is not comparable with this version'"" Please let me know if i can download the app in other sorce like your official link so i could continue my job.please tell me a way to download the app."
Why it shows that no such as meeting or failed to join meeting.
Google how to recored screen in google meet when you tell me the problem I give five stars to google meet
When I am opening Google meet in samsung m21 my mobile data is getting disconnected intermittently which is not allowing to join meetings. Any fix for this.
Old version is better than update version
"I cant join to my class because when i type the code it always say that ""no such meeting""."
Suddenly disconnected
This really bad because I have join meeting but I am organised the meeting I not having host control settings
It's ok
Good only I gave it 2 stars because its full like a glitch and we can't screen record when on this app
Previous version was best. In this vesrision full screen not well And on call chatting was very complicated not easy. Also there have no option of recent meeting. When accidentaly log out from the meeting then app not shows this meeting in recent (this option was in the previous vesrsion) so we again enter code or link.
It keeps crashing i dont know why. Can you help me i really need this one for my online class
It always ask me to rate
It's writing failed to join
Using for my school
Most of the time the app shows 'failed to join ' even if I don't face a network issue. I'm joining a meeting after trying a lot.
Very poor audio and video qualityq
Seems like there is no feature of turning off chat section...surprising and disgusting at the same time. Add the feature of chat disable immediately if you have not added yet.
Mast is a great way to get a new phone for you to use for the success of the world and the world of the world and the world of the world and
This app using my so many net

How should I screen record meeting It does nt allow to record sound
"There is no option of using orginal audio, it would be really helpful in further updates"
"I have seen my friends with updated version but im not getting that ,can i know why is this happening??"
unknown person joins the meeting and he disturbing the meeting and host can't remove that person and also can't mute them. this is big problem of this application.
"When I try to attend class it's failed every time ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ from last 4 or 5 days... Early app was work very good,but now why troubling meðŸ˜ž"
"This app is worst when i use in my laptop its showing ""you will be able to connect in just a moment"" but it cant connect......"
There is no background blur in more options
Not good app I always trouble in joining

Nothing to tell

So please fix the problem.I hope this will be fixed soon because I don't have any other phone to study . So please help me
"Poor video quality. If you improve a little more, then Meet will become the best app for online study."
This app is very user friendly and easy to use but please include options like 'disable chat' and 'mute all' because when it comes to online class it's difficult to mute every single one and to put an end to chatting in comment section.
It was working just fine for my last two subjects but in the following it kept saying failed to join meeting again and again i tried to restart and download and uninstall but its still the same and because of it i dindt get to attend my other two meetings... :<
I'm experiencing problem where others can't hear my audio even though my mic is on or even without a headset is still the same
We cannot split screen which horrible it is important because when online classes are going on we need to have that open
The screen gets full white randomly anytime while having a good internet I have to leave and join again it's annoying and disturbing
I'm hearing my own voice sometimes. Video and audio is not clear. No option of personal chat. I can't change my name in the meeting. And always the host leaves the meeting but the participants remain in. We can't enter without permission of host. When we present something in video we can't hear to the audio.
"Anisur Rahman, 2nd shift roll 149"
Need some improvement
My can't working on meeting
"My teacher sent me a link to the room but I can't get inside the link, saying i failed to join the meeting while my other classmate just got in easily and my network is working properly pls fix this"
Dis is best aap
Good
Needed the option for deleting the message in the chat box.
1. Data consumption is very high. 2. Should give a option to select video resolution That's all ðŸ‘
Picture quality is very low... Please improve it. Nothing can be seen clearly.
A normal app
We cant even change the layout. we can.only see one.person.
"This app is ok when I use from my computer but whenever I try to enter any meeting using my phone through my school account this app always tell me â€œUnfortunately, meet has stoppedâ€ . Please fix the bug!!!!"
I can't see people in video call in google meet ..so for that i don't like this app much..and in the screen says that UNFORTUNATELY meet has STOPPED...
First of all it worked good.. Today onwards i cant join in any meeting.its displaying failed to join the meeting.
It is not responding at all When we join a meeting we will be automatically removed and the audio is not clear at all. It will drain our battery fast and I can't see the presentation. Please fix these problems
This is make very problem because it not show the screen share and it's make very hang.
This app asking rating again and again during meeting.Some time it fails to join meeting
"It got a bug If someone try to join the meeting and he is not admitted once . He/she can still join by clicking 3-4 times on ask to join button (by reloading again and again) .(this bug is for both desktop version as well as the mobile app) Trust me it's a really big bug There is no privacy and someone can easily join the meeting and make the disturbance. Overall it's a good app ,but please consider this bug ........ Idk where to report a bug that's why I'm writing here in reviews"
I wont abdet
New update is difficult to operate
This is very nice app but when my call is coming my classes are over because of thatmy classes are over so if you are hearing this Google then please make this better for students. Thank you
I'll be there in a few minutes
Because the app is not coming properly when I am attending the class
It is good app but there is a promblem that screen is not show properly it is looking like a cloudy so please try to maintain this
I can't hear a voice in Google meet
After getting last update this app is not working on my android device..although my mobile is running on android 10...
"No available auto back and is not on ,not available personal chating..............................."

Good
"Very bad app.. Jb bhi meeting join krti hu, tbhi left ho jata h iski wajah se m class bhi join nhi kr pa rhi hu bht dinnooo seðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
"The app crashes very often,even when i'm in the meeting the app comes out of the meeting without my permission. Please also add dark mode."
Waste app zoom is better than this app when I am in the online class when I press back button the meeting will end but zoom not like that if we press back button it shows back to meeting the conference will not end but this google meet will end then again I should join the meeting 2 min time waste some of the class is gone if the teacher said the important thing I will miss it and presentation another will present the presentation will stop that's why google meet is waste
Not visible and audible
Kabhi kabhi isme sound eco hota h or vaoice delay bhi ho jati h or kabhi kabhi voice crack bhi ho jati h.
Useful but......the video is blurry.. Not clear as I want. that's the reason behind to give â­â­ If the video was clear i had gaved â­â­â­â­â­ but the another prblm is that thise app show's rate us rate us again and again also if i had rate it
Bad app voice and video is not clear
"For some reason, the mobile app doesn't support my headphones. It does on pc. But not on mobile. Please look to this"
I done feedback but no changes were there in the screen and number of people
This app is very good for classes and liked it but from few days I'm hearing that the meeting time is reduced to only 60 min .If we want to exceed the 60 min in a meeting the we should pay for it. Is it true..? I hope that I'll get a quick response from your side.. Thank you....
But mere phone mai google update nhi mang rha ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Nice
"Battery charge ends very fast in this app other than, it is good and sometimes unable to use mic bcz screen gets hanged"
"why are you limiting the meeting to 60 min. for free users? we're only relying to free plans, this sucks! capitalism sucks! we're not that rich"
This is good for the start but then i start joining and keep saying failed to join meeting or no such meeting im just gonna unistsll then install this but it keep saying failed to joing meeting or no such meeting now my teacher is mad at me and second i have google meet in my com but i cannot connect my web cam ugh this drives me crazy
"Bad, always failed join meet"
In this app we are not allowed to record videos and when we record video the audio in not audible plzz.... fix this problem .we really want this option
After 30 September free meeting session in meet is ended?
Video blur issue
"When in a meeting suddenly reconnect repeatedly. But if I use other meeting applications this doesn't happen (Btw, I use Indihome internet service provider from Indonesia). I don't know if the cause is from an application / internet service provider / unstable connection."
"For me, I have the bad experience..when the meeting start I cannot stop presenting and all the teachers were yelling at me to stop presenting....... I feel really sad"
The latest updated version is not good at all.My daughter is facing problems in her online classes.now it only shows her maam and she.she could see her classmates name appears but could not open their windows and see them.

No tile view in this mobile version? And settings seem to be limited. Can't imagine why I can't set the same configuration as the web version.
Very poor version... We are not liking the latest version... Kindly give us back the old version..this is draining lots of battery...
"Frst days it was excellent.but but now,it's having lot of issues.I can't join classes because of network issue created by the app."

"First off the new update is the complete opposite of the previous one.In this update I keep getting a message saying""no internet connection"" or ""failed to join meeting"" it directly takes me to Gmail,which has a comparatively smaller and less efficient screen than the previous update,if a person if speaking he or she is not directly brought up to the screen,and of course the notifications you cannot see while what your typing :( I hope the next update brings changes."
What to use Google gmail meet or this app make it one

Can we get dark theme in google meet...??
The google meet app used to work properly and smoothly during this 6 months but after updating now whenever i open the app it doesnt open and shows no internet but at that time all other apps work properly and aIso when i use wifi hotspot it works properly but doesnot open while using my mobile data so i kindly request you to fix this bugs so that i can attend my online classes
This app is not a good app.. I don't like this
This app is nice but it does not support split screen. It creates a lot of problem.
The app keeps exiting in between the meets at times. I can't hear what others are speaking in the meet. Tried from two different devices. Please resolve it soon.
6 months
Auido was very bad
"Many times video is delayed,the video is blur ,rest the app is very easy to use,. Also captions don't come for other languages than English.."
Its quality was not good but its function was so good
My online classes are going through this app......The one and only problem in this app is the screen what our teacher sharing is not clear also sometimes the sound is not clear.......Every students in our class has same kind of problem even our network connection is fine.......please fix this problem
Everything was fine. But now any meeting link does get connected. It just says Failed to join meeting.

"Its a good app, but split screen is apparently not supported."
Not good
Bad
Very BAd
Uses a lot more mobile data than other meeting apps... I would not recommend this app for a 1.5 GB/day user... especially during lockdown when we have to work/study online
Super
Can anybody tell me that how to join through Gmail in meet there is no option in my gmail app or not in meet please tell me google LLC has replied me that it will available after few weeks till now it hasn't available
Although the app is very nice but some times it fails to connect the meeting......
Faltu app
Super
Plz set an option for recording meetings in phones.
Video quality s not good
GOOGLE MEET SHOULD KEEP THE PARTICIPANTS OPTION SEPERATE WHICH WILL HELP TO ENLARGE THE SCREEN SIZE. THERE IS NO NEED OF SEEING THE NAME OF PARTICIPANTS
"During the meeting, sometime I am not able to see the screen. The whole screen turn White, which create issune in my study. Please don't send star rating in the meeting when meeting is over."
Hey Google meet I am not able to see options to present something The options like Microsoft one drive Google drive Box Photo Documents Web url Bookmark Screen White board It is only presenting our screen and notifications.......
It was good
Does not work with mobile internet in the move!
"The video quality is too bad. I searched the internet and came across the Google Meet official page where they showed the facility of changing the video quality, but unfortunately, I failed to find the feature in the installed app."
The video quality is not good as compared to zoom app
"So good and so useful ðŸ™‚ I use this app for my online studies... I really love this app ðŸ˜ named ""Google Meet"" Not like that ðŸ˜‚ I mean The latest update is worst!! I love this app but not it's Latest Update.. It's the Irritating app!!"
Always rate us rate us like tat one message will be coming and our meet will be ended again we have to join once again a big problem
Mst
I can't hear someone I can't present the screen so this is bad
Application is always hanging while meeting in landscape mode and when we try to unmute during call it is hanging and application exits while some times respond back after 40 sec or more delay. This is a serious issue Google meet needs to fix.
Please remove Google meet from gmail I don't want to join meetings from gmail instead of Google meet.
Not bad
Good but not available to cheat in exam Please add to cheat in exam
Nice
Video blured
Bad
No entry for more than 100 people
When some meetings are going on don't know why that PLEASE RATE THIS APP and some times meet is not responding it comesðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”that's why I gave 2 stares
I bought new mobile only for the classes even in the new mobile it won't work the mobile has 8 gb ram and it is not working if u think it's network issue I have WiFi in my house which has 60 Mbps speed.so this app won't work.the idea of the app is good but need to improve like a lot.and Google I visited the helpline which is of no use.
Even after rejoining many times I am unable to see others video I am getting some yellow lines while the phone users on their camera.There is no problem with the videos of laptop users. Please solve it
It is not clear during my online classðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­
Super
Voice problems
"When I try to connect with any meeting my mobile data automatically turn off, It needs wifi every time. Plz fix it or give me some instructions to solve this issue."
Not so good
I think that chating personally with the members should be available.it is available in other apps. There's a need of talking personally so plz as early as possible make it available
I want update version of the app
Not so good
Disconnected may times ... And even many time audio/video break in between session
"The app is great... when it works. I have no idea why, but recently I haven't even been able to open it. Whenever I press it, it just crashes. I've tried restarting my phone, uninstalling the app, clearing cache, etc. Edit: one thing did work, which is not giving access to my microphone and camera."
There can not be video recording beside orgniser
Even when the networks are good then too the video and audio are distorted. Microsoft teams is a way better than Google meet.
Wow
Google LLC i want this problem to be solved...... I have updated my Google meet 2 times but my meet is not coming updated (as after updating it should come in black theme) i am waiting for new update but new update is not there..... {I am having this problem in VIVO V3 mobile}
I don't like this app it keeping coming out the meeting and I'm missing out on what is being taught in class
This is a really beautiful app..But I have a problem...There is a message when I enter it ...It says I am on a phone call so I will not be allowed to enter it...But I am not associated with any phone call at that time...I would really benefit if this problem of mine could be solved...My important work is being disrupted...Please help me ...
Can you please add blur background on phone because in some cases it is important to have blur background after getting the blur background I am gonna give this app 5 stars
we cannot see the person video well. the video calling is too bad and small. zoom is better than this and kindly include private chat also
High amount of data is used while using at morning. Charge decreases very fast.
Whenever i open google meeting link it's redirected to gmail meet tab. Even if meet tab is disabled in gmail it still doesn't open in google meet. Please fix this.
It keeps disconnecting
I want black mode in Google meet
It only shows update option but it generally not happens .
There is a issue when our mam present screen sometimes it gets white or it shows us pixel of the sentence which mam wrote on board..

Worst app
Every time rate now rate now caption come after already rated the app. Bad
Google meet app is nice
It has a poor camera quality and most of the times someone is presenting the audio and video are not in sync and it never joins me on time even if i am having an proper internet connection
Nice
After 10-15 min from start of meeting the video call got freeze and then the app get crashed i don't know whats the problem Google please help!
"The app is good and all . But the major issues i faced are - 1) Screen rotation. The Landscape mode becomes potrait and vice versa. So when i rotate my phone to landscape it becomes portrait. 2) Very high battery consumption and phone heating. My phone heats up insanely ONLY while using this application. Even fps game like PUBG doesn't heat my phone up. But this app does. 3) When i get a link and try opening it, it takes too long to open. I have an 8gb RAM phone. I don't understand why !?."
It is good but when i on the camera no body can see me
Baaaad quality sound and video Ok ish connections. Suitable for small meets
When I am sharing images they are delivered so much blurred . Student couldn't see it properly
So far function is good. But what made me give two stars is because in last two three meetings in the middle of meeting it ask for me to rate if I don't it just closes and if I do it still closes and very hard to rejoin or can't rejoin at all. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars
How to join more than 100 people in one meeting
I give 2 star because When i join meeting's following problems occurs several times 1- The audio breaks up 2-I couldn't hear others And these problems affect my study. I request google to fix these problems.
"Why does my camera get mirrored? It makes my face looks weird... I'm using android, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE MY FACE LOOKS SO WEIRD ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
Previous version is much better than this version please retake this update
The latest update is not good at all.The old one was better. We can't chat while viewing the screen. As I do all my meetings on the mobile phone this new update doesn't show the presented screen in full screen as it was in the older version. Please do the needful or bring the older version back.
Good
"Video,audio,presentation al need improvement"
Just there is a problem while the meeting is going on that is the statement which is coming from this app Called( HOW WAS THE AUDIO AND VIDEO?) this is what the problem which I face is
Good
"Other video apps are better, this gets cuts almost always, cant hear continuously"
"Iam leaving the meet consistently , I don't know why may be it is a problem of wifi but It going smooth when I take YTube .... Please fix this if there is any bug or something and I COULDN'T HEAR ANY ONE ðŸ™„"
Can't listen anything
When class is going on Then there is a notifications to review tha app If i click not now then i will disconnect from class

It's good app but my microphone doesn't work only
"This app is not so good as zoom app beacause , if we double clicks the back button it's directly cut meeting and we again have to join meeting again , its too boring and the screen can't be horizontal and one more problem that is we cannot chat privately with our classmates or friends."

It's stops meeting and asks for review .needs lots of changes. 1. There should be on co-host 2. Who handles administration during meeting. 3. Presentation with permission should cover whole screen. 4. It should be working on 2G. etc
O gof
Very bad experience
Very nice aap Best control
Not so good ðŸ˜¡
Clarity not better
"I never see videos on my screen, just black screen instead. Is supposed to be a video meeting solution right"
It's not connecting with Google classroom....
Voice breaking mainly video blur
The screen I glitchy all the time and I can see and the sound quality is horrible and I can't here people most of the time. And yes I'm always connected
To much DRAMA!
Sound quality is very poor
"Sometimes Mike doesn't work. Sometimes, my teacher asks me anything My Mike stops working So please, it's a request, fix it. Google LLC- I have given permission to access my microphone. Bro what are you saying. I always switch on my microphone whenever I have to converse. I'm telling you. App isn't designed well. Fix it ðŸ˜Š"

Good
Major Bug - Whenever I pin myself I see the host's feed on the thumbnail but if I try to pin the host the feed disappears and goes white. Terrible Bug. Please fix it..
"At first the app worked great. But then for no reason it just started crashing. It says ""no network connection"" , which is really strange because I am not even using wifi, I'm using my mobile data. I have tried to fix, but nothing works. I need to use google meet because I am an online student. If I miss the meets then I will lose points and attendance for the week. You can see why this is a problem. I hope it gets fixed because I am starting to get really frustrated."
"I faced some problem in google meet from last two months. Audio is breakeble , video and audio didn't match.. and I can't present my screen. When I start presenting meet stops automatically . Please try to make a solution of this prblm otherwise it will be a big problem in joining my classes"

This is a very amazing app but the problem of this app is the video is blurry
I couldn't have added 5 stars because my video is not seeing to others and others couldn't see my face and I am also not seeing my friends face this is very big problem for me but my friends camera is good she is seeing our face and teacher also seeing her face but my camera is not good
Vedio is good but audio is very bad
Google meet sucks ðŸ˜“. It requires more bandwidth than most other meeting apps. Don't know why it just kicks me out of meeting! Even if press back button it should ask me whether I really want to leave. But no! It kicks me out. I wonder this is a product by google.
Good
Why you made this app
Good but not very good because video is breaking up and can't see others properly and I can't hear others properly
Good ðŸ‘
Good
A very good app for meeting ......it helped me a lot ..... everything is fine ....adding two more options will make this app perfect the two options are 1)we shoud have a option to mute the other participants who r disturbing..2)we should have a option to remove the unknown participants THEN I WILL SURE RATE THIS APP 5ðŸŒŸ
"It was working well for 3 months, but recently audio and video quality is down. So not able to take class. Please resolve the issue."
Worst app for me It takes too much data Comparing to other app its the worst app But the reasong i give it 2 stars because it has screen sharing We can show everything in this app
I cannot join meet video call...why? Solve this problem.
Google meet is a good aap but the Google meet voice is eco and the picture of the Google meet is bloor
Please make the app like zoom because like this we are not able to see Avery one at a time. This important point must be added ðŸ¤¢
I have facing audio and video problems like video wasn't clear and audio wasn't audible full echo..
"It's a nice app..we have option to off and on our video any time it's a wonderful app.....ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ ,,,I have faced one problem ,,but when I restart my phone ,,the problem solved..ðŸ‘ðŸ‘â¤ .............I am facing one problem that voice and video not clearly coming. ....."
Older meet was better than current release... Now I can't switch profiles also..
This app comes some bugs. When I join the meeting it will lefting automatically please fix the problem ASAP becouse of this bug I lost my attendance
I'm always unable to unmute my mic when ever I use this app... ! Please do something about this !It suddenly gets me out of the meet and very often (always) asks for feedback...which I give each time it asks for ! But still it does the same...day by day this problem is becoming worse... I'm unable to interact with people during the meet... I'm unable to unmute my audio ! it irritates! It's not satisfying.... please do consider this feedback !! Hope it doesn't show the same after this feedback !!
Good
When we mistakenly click on back button then meeting ends Please off this feature
"mic is off during meeting ""Mic is off due to size of call"""
Good
Everytime in between the meet there appears the rating window and i got disconnected from the meet...plz dont do this...its troublesome...thats only the issue otherwise everything is ok
Whenever I try to present or turn on my vidio I autoquit. Google llc I request to solve this.
Video and voice quality is too bad
"I'm in a scheduled Google Calendar and meet linked conference, but for the past few days I'm able to join the meet but no audio or presented screens are visible I can see who had their mic on but i can't hear anything also if I move the app to the background it'll automatically get disconnect. I'm the only one in the class experiencing this because of this I'm losing classes and attendance. This issue is with this calendar linked conference only. Please resolve this Google LLC."
Doesn't work well on 2G
Nice aap
Alow options of recording meeting for free please... ðŸ™ðŸ¼ðŸ™ðŸ¼ðŸ™ðŸ¼ðŸ™ðŸ¼
Not good
The previous version is better than this as there it is easy to see who are in the meeting and easy for chatting also.. Another thing i want is to see is the private chat in the meeting. Please make the audio and video quality better.
I cannot listen others
I give 1 star because in that app there is not a seprate chate
"I am giving 2 stars because its not working properly, between the meeting its stop and not working still meeting is over."
I want old version latest update was not so good ðŸ™ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜
good
App is good but when ever I use in landscape mode app crashes instantly and some times others face become black and white
Okay okay
Good app
I don't like this app just ok
It is nice app but i have seen in many phones they are updated and in mine tbere is no option for update not so satisfied ðŸ˜‘
it works fine in my mobile phone but not in my tablet
"It works for video calls, but it's not great. Zoom is still better in terms of quality and settings. Meet sometimes cuts my audio for no reason and I sometimes get kicked out of meetings."
Some time I can't join my class because of the app stop responding back and even stop working I try many times then my class time over still I m trying to attend the next meeting through it
Google has many issues : 1. It disconnects when a call comes or you do something else 2. You need to manually allow people to enter the meet. If all are doing some physical activity then people will just wait 3. Can't see everyone clearly like in zoom 4. Voice quality is also lacking compared to Zoom 5. There is no facility like anyone can join meeting without host like zoom. 6. Meeting Occurance facility should be there. 7. Google meet user interface is not good as compared to zoon app
It doesn't open directly to the application evrytime I open the link and it keep on saying the app can't download but it's already there.
Good app
Poor
"It doesn't feel like its the same as the pc version. Easy to set up and connect. Not much more function than Zoom. BTW. Support, when you provide a link, is it possible to allow us to click on it or copy that text to paste in a browser. At the moment we have to transcribe that piece of text. I think the problem is this editer software."
Could have been better
"This is a good app for attending meetings , but sometimes it gives trouble. Somes times I couldn't hear any one , and other will not hear me. Sometime it automatically back . As I am a student I have to attend my class reguarly . So plzz make it more better."
Too battery draining app.
Hi I am a user of google meet I am not able to join any meetings the network is going off. Only while taking the meet the network is going off. While using another apps there is no such problem. Please fix it. I have gone through and fixed my network problems but while opening the google meet network is going off with my data on
Been having issues login in to google meet. Ive tried resetting it 3 times and still not working for me. Don't know why but last 3 days nothing seems to work for me .
At some point in the meeting l cant hear the audio and see video even if my network connectivity is pretty strong. Please reply to me google .what to do. It is causing inconvenience while using the aap.My device runs on android version 9.
Cant process
This was good before but now its becoming slow. Especially the desktop version.
I was update this app. But when I press the sended link they said that not such meeting. What's the reason??
"Ever since the update on Sep 21, I couldn't access any links my teachers were posting. Please fix this, I enjoy the old Google Meets better."
Plse don't ask rating .Because I am during examination you ask about rating and plse repeat againðŸ™
"Fed up , as it keep on asking "" how was the audio""? After every 5 min, n gets disconnected. By the time again we connect , this app will b ready again with the question how was the app? Even you give 5 star , it keep on repeating n getting disconnected"
Good I
It's a very bad app â˜¹ï¸
I hate latest update ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ please bring the old version back. This one sucks. Can't see the presentation full screen. Which is very very uncomfortable. I request you to fix it back to normal. Also can't see my professor in full screen. Which is very important for me to look at the white board and copy down. I request once again to fix it back. I know the probablity of you reading this is very low. But I request you to reply me if you read this and help me to fix with it. Thank you.
Takes too much data
Jjj
"I AM USING THE GOOGLE MEET APP IN MY PHONE. THE ERROR GOES ON OCCURING . THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT I FOUND WAS TO , FIRST CONNECT WITH MOBILE DATA AND THEN CONNECT TO WIFI THERE AFTER CONNECTING INTO THE MEETING"
I like this app in the starting but now when I start meeting it says how was audio and video and when I rate and also click on not now it closes meeting and it comes every 10 minutes please fix this
This is a best app for teaching but it consumes all most 75%of battery so I have given only 2 stars
"I have a good network connection, but it is not access internet . It was working correctly in starting but is no longer working.internet speed is coming right in all other apps."
It is really really disappointed because1. allowing permission and the wrost part is it 2.automatically Disconnect participants in low signal and more over I am really disappointed please there are more bugs in it fix it and Google I Didn't expect this from you and I am really disappointed with this.
I want private message option
This app is good but bad also the video quality is very poor and the audio quality also. I reported many times but nothing happens.

Worst video and audio quality even with good internet connection and latest version.
The latest update was not good as before It's difficult to search a person's chat as the list of participants name is not in alphabetical order. Also we cant use chat while viewing a screen. I feel the previous one was very comfortable to use. Whereas this irritates me while in the meet.
"Its s good conferencing app but it creates an echo on voice, the other's sound gets delayed the video gets blurred.... So it need to get a fix at this problem.... Thank you"
Isme alag se ham apne friends se baate nahi kar sakte jaisa ki zoom app me hota hai agar ye system aa jaye to hame aur bhi accha lagega Thank you

Really good aap but now just a new problem When I tap the link it open but in not Google meet it opens in Gmail meet why it happen
"Major issue1:I can't see the messages I type in in-chat messages because for some reason meet shows a pop-up black box right at the place where you are supposed to see your typed messages!! And that to for a good 3 seconds!! telling me who joined and who left( like anyone cares enough). Issue 2: I want my meeting to open in this damn app and not on Gmail app, for some not understood to my puny mind, I tried everything changing preference etc. And I don't like meet in Gmail app."
"Video call class is verry important..but it's app ranningly off ...so,I think it's app verry bad quality"

Why my device heats while online classes ???
Google: please start working on the video screen . As the video showed to us is not full screen and sometime to adjust that it take a lot of time . Rest all is good.
Can't connect to the Wi-Fi while the app is running
In this step the voice is breaking and the picture is not clear
Its a useless app.

I am very sorry to tell that I was not able to hear anyone in the meeting and a message used to come every time asking me to rate the app... And if l do rate it then l would have to remain the meeting.....
I have not liked the app bacause bullers ask permission to admit with an freindly name and profile pic later know that it is a buller not a real person whom i knows if i give him permission a time then he can enter and exit without my permission. Even i can not have any option mute all and dont allow participants to unmute for themselves .

I can't record meeting in xiomi A3 ðŸ˜ 
No Full screen option for presentation?! The participant lists occupy the majority of the screen.
Cant see videos of some people. Just a blank white screen
It sturcing
From some days when I am attending lectures the screen became white i can't able too se person who is teaching i think its network issue but it also happening when I am using wifi the screen became fully white so i can't understand concepts
Wow
I have been using Meet app for doing meetings and there is a section for sending the message to everyone. I want in that developers should add a feature for deleting the message that you have sent for everyone or edit your message because if we type something by mistake or if sent something that is grammatically incorrect we can edit that or we can simply remove that for everyone. Rest is nice. Thanks
I can't join some classes this is the worst experience I ever had
"There is something wrong with the app, as I usually attend my classes on my phone so the problem is that I am not able to see my teachers video at all there is just plain white screen which appears. I have already tried existing and rejoining but it is not making any sort of difference"
"Good,but video quality is bad."
It is very annoying when all the students start presenting in the middle of the class one by one. Add this feature to restrict who can present their screen
After update the app is using most of the battery.
From some days my meeting join with Gmail why this is happening ?..... My meeting not joining from Google meet while I have installed and updated this app......
Okk
In this app there are too many problem such as video quality is not good and voice is not come clearly
Not so good
The other person's vedio goes of..and I need to log out and then login again......but again after some time the vedio goes blank.....it happens so frequently....and my net speed is not so bad (1mbps)
In
When I toch link it was opening through gmail
"I m not able to do class in Google meet from last 2 weeks ,as whenever I try it is showing Gmail .Why?"
Hnm this is very nice app
Good app but caption feature is not able to properly translate in English
I used to love this app but after an update this appa has changed like everything about it has changed. No the chatbox is somewhere else and that is soooo annoying. Do something about it .
Whenever I am opening the app it is saying connect to google.....I am a poor person....I don't know much about phones....So please help me Google... Nowadays I can't watch online classes. .. I had tried the things you told but now also it is not connecting
please fix the bug... the apps often crash when the meeting is ongoing
For the rating of this app comes when meeting is going on and it disconnected friquently
Please add the user block feacture for the session and disply the user gmail id . Add white and black list for gmail id . So that i can manage the unwanted user.
I'll join a meeting but after two meetings it will just say that its failed to join the meeting or there no such meeting i already tried unstalling it and install it again but it just keep saying failed to join the meeting
Fast not download
Good
Plz do not suggest for rating all time
It was ok but profile settings was so problem to change profile
It was bad. The update made it worse. Add features to 1. remove someone from meeting so that he requires permission to join again 2. Make it easier to rejoin meeting if I got disconnected due to any problem.
Not able to open
I m student When I enter in Google meet i can't hera anythink i have to rejoin the meeting and these days even teacher's can't hear me. What is the solution? Please reply me fast
Please provide the option of recording the meeting in the app.
"The newest update is not at all good in the phone.. Everybody are so small and I cannot see more than 3 people at the bottom. And when I go to the participants list, users cannot see me. And I cannot find where remove and mute options are. The older version was much much better. Pls solve these issues at the earliest. Only then will I change my rating"
We cannot delete the message but good
Failed to Join the Meeting always shown
I'm facing the issue from last 45days unable to join even though i have accepted invitation and even in the recent updation from gmail still unable to join and gets disconnected not ok with the solve
"Why have you added meet feature in Gmail app if you're giving a separate app for that, also whenever i click a meet link it takes me to Gmail's meet instead of original app and the Gmail's meet interface is soo weird and inconvenient. Please normalise Gmail app and remove meet feature or at least prioritise that if I'm having meet app the meeting should open there only"
"Kung di tungod sa online class , di ko kaila nimo. Ambot hasul kaayo. Lord panabangi. Kalhas kaayog data, wa naku malipay."
Well it's not that bad cause it helps me with my learning but it has some issues first it refuses to let me in the meeting even if I have 4g network it says failed to join Meeting second it consumes alot of data it also ends calls by itself you better answer me that is why I didn't rate it 5 star......
Meet is very useful app in this pandemic situation for students but we are unable to cast screen to Nokia smart TV. There is no option for screen cast to other devices.
Vedieos are too much blurry
Very worst app
Sometimes it not open... So I missed so many meetings I hate it
"In mobile couldn't do screen settings. Half of the screen will occupy contracts name, only other half can see the video/presentation."
Your app is very good but i give it 2 stars out of 5 because this is so boring very boring app in the world
Good
I hate this app bcz his voice is very bad
Akshay
ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
The attendence with time is not really good.so please remove that option.. Google please take care of it...
Very bad Because google meet join and network is automatically off
The new update of joining a meeting directly using gmail seems to have issues. The interface has changed completely to a dark theme. I personally liked the original interface of google meet (the white interface). Kindly change the necessary.
144p quality Quality is not good
Not well
This is very good but make sure other participants also record the meeting. This should not only for host.

Do you need the Google meet app on your phone to use all it's features? Yesterday I joined a Google meet session through Gmail and I couldn't use the video and the microphone. I was not even sure if I could type anything in the chat box.... It was weird
"It's really good but sometimes it's kind of irritating. Coz whenever I join a meeting it pops up the notification of ""do u like the video and audio"" I did give the feedback but it doesn't stop it just pops up again and again. Tat time I need to leave the meeting. ...."
How to keep the camera ON even if the app is minimised or switched to another app?
Audio and video are not clear.
I have troubleshooting in opening Google meet. Fix the bugs and give us new update.
I love these app but i have a problem i these app.When i am opening these app and connecting with my bluetuth head phone the voice iscoming louder but after sometimes the voice is coming lower. So what can i do.

Everything is ok but while staying in a meeting after when I reopened the app I saw my video and my mic was hanged . I have good network connection but still it happens after I update also. I want it to be run smoothly. Thank you Souhardya Ojha
This is a very bed
Awesome
Automaticaly leaving in between the meeting
I am in little confusion.I am getting a different interface of Google meet during meeting.I don't know why it's so? Though many of my friends updated recently also but not getting the same interface as of mine.They are having the regular interface.Solve my problem ASAP.
It was okay. But online classes suck so ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸.
It's using too much of internet!!!! Pls make changes in it
Why is the meeting link opens through Gmail app even though I have the latest version of google meet app installed? The integration with gmail is fine but it's difficult to see the screen as the presentation window is small. There should be an option asking users to join either through Gmail or meet app instead of forced opening through Gmail. Please fix this issue.
When I will came out from meeting all time report menu will be came but I reported already ðŸ˜¬
What happen to google unity.I face failing get in through the classes.Am a student .I lost my attendance .This suckðŸ˜¤
"It has an opening issue, it take very much time to open, that's a verybbig problem"

It is good app ðŸ˜ðŸ¤”
"Not good quality of sound and video is also blur . Overall it is not a good app , there's always an eco in voice of people , No option to mute all So, the host has to face a lot of problem ."
After the update the app has become useless. The voice is cracking.
"After update ,it was very difficult to see the running comments in chat box , disable this new update !!!"
"I am not facing any issues only sometimes it malfunctions but it's the best video meeting app. first time rated 5 stars but it doesn't worked well and I faced many issues it crashes, it glitches so I rated 2 stars"
New update is not that much good.... I give 5 Star for previous version
"It's getting disconnected when I join a meeting immediately. It is showing that he running out of time in joining this meet, technically I'm loosing all my meetings."
This app was a good app for a month but after that it started showing failed to join the meeting it was really annoying
It's good but why you always ask about feedback... We give you the feedback ones then why you again and again ask about the feedback ðŸ˜¡

Google meet is not working properly...my teacher send us the link but I am unable to join as it was always showing 'failed to connect meeting'..I tried several times but all the time the response was same...on the other hand my all apps were running smoothly except this...please fix it soon
"While this is a great app, it used to be way better before the update recently. The captions are slow to update and usually are very behind, you cannot kick anyone from the meeting anymore. That is the biggest problem now. I was in my class and someone joined on an account and none of us could kick him, and even worse they started playing vulgar music and pornography on the screen while presenting. The microphone has a load of echo as well. However the app is great with video and voice. Thanks!"
Should board for writing purpose and have fullscreen option
Won't open the meeting. Will try uninstalling and installing again.
It's not working well sometimes

Di ko magamit ng maayos deputs
Very good
After last update whenever I am clicking any meeting URL it is opening from Gmail not from meet
Please dont distrub not working voice connections
Y i give three stars mean it is stuking soo much
Eating data like food.
New update is not good at all. Old UI was good easy to use and also user friendly Change the design to old one
Not good
The problem in this app is that it should be shown who is the host of the meeting because when students join through g classroom they remove each other and teachers are unable to know who is removing students. Also a raise hand option should also be there. Otherwise the app is very nice
"I will give two stars to this app because when teacher sending the code to all of us we joined the class ,after two three minutes when I got bore I DISTURB the class a lot and in anger tr scolds me and then she remove's me from the meeting and then I am rejoining it's showing that, there is no such meeting pls solve my problem ."
"If we tap to back then it closes, that's annoying"
I will the info to your email because the chat box requires adjustment big adjustments and soon
I give 2 star because in this aap voice is not clear and we cannot see the photo
Bad App
When i download this app it says that unfortunately meet has stopped...what the hell is that .....plz help me
I got kicked somehow and cant get inside the meeting again
It not working some times...
It is good but it take too much data balance
"Every thing is going good . The video and audio issues were solved , but it keeps crashing a lot now."
Good app but it's want feedback during the class then I give and then disconnected from the class. This is again and again done its very irritating
"Can't hear others,the presentation was blurred.."
Nice app
Very bad app. Can't mute any participant for privacy. Some are lefting the class and joining again at the end of the class for getting attendance. The remain absent for most of the time and by joining again at the last they are getting attendance. Please fix this problem. I have also sent feedback in the app 6 months ago but nothing is being changed. I don't have any proof who are leaving. .Very less power for the host to hold a meeting properly. Please fix it.
"With the new update there have been many changes , I can adjust to the new layout however I hate the fact that you can't see/type messages in the chat box and look at the screen that is being presented at the same time, it's very inconvenient, please fix this issue"
Its good
Really disappointed ....i m not able to join or create any meetings
I love this app but now update is not good that's why I gave 2 star
Not so good
It is a good app but it consumes too much data as compared to other meeting apps
Ok app hai jabardast
Google meet secure
It's not connecting. Failed to join meeting
I want to get new version of this app my friend said he gets new version
"New version, sucks down to the core.. You should realise that pandemic time is stressful for everybody and an update should make things easy.. Teachers are familiar with older version and learned it. Now you update then make things complex."
The app is good for online study but causes disturbance by asking feedback when the class is going on
"During the meeting , something I am not able u see the screen ..the whole screen turn white, which create issue in my study .. Some tym it is clear.. But most of the tym screen turn white. And sometimes sound is breaking.."
"There are so many problem like voice is not coming or they cannot hear us ,video is blured ,presentation is blured so i give them 2 star"
"Why you guys sending me notification for star rating, video and audio feaure in the middle of the meeting in every time and everyday. When i am giving some rating automatically i am leaving from the meeting. If further this will happen then i will uninstall this app."
Upgration was not helpful
"Why you guys sending me notification for star rating, video and audio feaure in the middle of the meeting in every time and everyday. When i am giving some rating automatically i am leaving from the meeting. If further this will happen then i will uninstall this app."
The voice is breaking but this is good app for study and meetings
Good app
Super
There are way too many bugs in the app. I never manage to join the meet when a link is clicked on. It would be great if Google actually fix it.
"Very bad app can't connect to the class properly and when I enter this app suddenly my 4g network vanishes ,it shows no tower. I am college student attending my online classes using this but this is very bad experience for meðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
This app extremely use battery. Please solve this problem

Good app
Why participant can't record the meeting without permission of host as a student I really need recording of the meeting ðŸ™ PLZZ add the feature of recording without permission I like Google meet app but ....
Latest update of UI is really annoying. I think previous version was way better than the latest one. Please rollback the previous version for my device atleast.
Hi Google ! I am a student . I hoped it as excellent as first service but no it's was very disappointed .
"It's the worst, I can't say more than this... Very disappointed..."
We can't record video on normal mobiles sometimes it poses too much problem than other apps in the absence of network issue
Please improve the app asap
"This app is worst app, I had ever seen. This signal or internet connection is very high but this app (Google meet) will not take signal!!! At other this app brings the ratings How was the audio and video, between the meeting, please fix the bug so it will be little betterðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£"
"Stupid app..go learn from Webex.I thought G meet was better..but no. I unmuted my mic to tell..but they couldn't hearl due to the problem in this G meet,when I used it in my laptop. ðŸ˜’"

"Before,its work perfectly,but now ,even after updated,cannot even work,error fetching calendar,I can't enter meeting,the true code cannot be use,link to Google meet cannot enter ,fix that,"
"while everyone is leaving in masses, their notification of departure covers up the chat box not letting me type anything.... its just one notification of a person leaving after another....if 50 people left at the same time there is going to be a departure notification for every single one of them right... sure you can have that but atleast let it not overlap the chat box where you type."
I am a student and when i enter the code that my teacher gave me it will say that there is no meeting but when i transfer to my other gadget there is a meeting i try restarting my phone and it still won't
"From today whenever i wanted to join my online classes ,i open the link and when the apps open my data connection had lost . I reinstalled the app but it repeat the same thing with me."
Because net waste very more. I attended one video and this is use my 800 MB data.
Create meeting option doesnot come in app.
Good
It a very good meeting study aap
Too much net consumption so need very good update to lesser net consumption
Very poor app
Please tell how to enable voice recording for meet while using screen recorder app
Not problem
Good app but sometimes I automatically leaved from meeting when the data was on and sometimes voice and audio was not clear
Very bad
why I can't see other participants?
Audio isn't audible to participants while sharing video in meeting.
Takes too much Battery.
App is very good but this app is consuming large amout of battery while using it more half an hour
Bad
It is best app. but it not subbort my old model android version 4.4.2.
When I use present screen options and presenting by using videos then other participants can't hear video's sound.. And to many bugs in app... please improve..
"I can't join the meeting, it's telling me failed to join"
Meetings are closed when a phone call is came into my phone. Pls solve the problem.

In this app is the voice sometimes breaks and the camera showing is also not good And please give a update of changing background while open camera
Give us option of private chat also like zoom apk please
Everything is best but there is only 1 thing that want in this app is private chat. If you add private chat than most of people will like this app and use this app more than Zoom app. Please add private chat.
Breaking vedio and audio I cannot listen the online class carefully....
As I am using this app from past 4months for my classes but today it is showing that failed to login to the meet. What would be the problem and please reply as fast as you can.

This app is not working properly and when I join the meeting link it tell failed to join meeting so for this reason I give two â­â­ If I think this app is working so I will give 5 star but at all I love this app
"I wish Google Play Store had a down-date button also, because I want this new meet update. Chat was one step away previously and now I need it takes 3 steps. They ruined it like Google keyboard."
App is totally good..video and audio quality is very good actually. But when the app is minimized in case we have to check another things you need on phone..google meet is showing in the background like display damage. I checked it somany times if the issue is with the phone or anything else..but i finally figured out it happends only when this app is opened.
This app was super
Not working properly
"If we compared Google meet with zoom. zoom is much better than Google meet bcz zoom provide us facilities like both we can personlly message to particular participant or we can message to everyone (in the meeting ) during zoom meeting whereas Google meet has only option of message to everyone during meeting, I feel is this is the major weakness of Google meet."
It consumes very more data And the presentation is also poor
Good app for online teaching. But I want to know how to mute all participants at a time in Android. This is possible with PC but in Android how it can be possible. Please suggest.
When we received call its got disconnected so disgusting.....
This app is great on online class........
This was not good app
Very nice app
It breaks connection very often
The chat box where we type...there's what the problem is .The reason is when the notifications of someone joining the meeting or while leaving the meeting the notification annoys cuz at that moment we can't type text or send the texts bcoz of it over covering the chat box...plz make it right ..something that won't disturb us while chatting when someone leaves or joins
Maine ise 2 star isaliye diye kyu ki hum isme personal message nahi bhej sakte hai
Everything is really good but it the meeting ends automatically and then I have to login again which takes alot of time
Nice
Nice
Please support split-screen mode and PIP mode.
Not good
Tek ha
Please alert function aad kr dijia ( agar mera network problem ho tho alert dikhai jisse pta chle ki network kiska khrab h ) ðŸ‘ðŸ™
The update is really poor mate... I'm sorry ðŸ˜”!!!!
"This app uses the most data... When I uses this app for my online classes, the data ends in the 1st or 2nd period only..."
Good
"Why google is not adding the feature of private messaging between meetings , I'm requesting you it 2 nd time please add the feature If you add the following feature i will give it 5 star"
It is very good app it is very comfortable for listening and voice but it cannot eat bricks a wise and pictures
"It's not enough good. It uses a lot of net and we can't complete all classes because of this. Second , it blurs out everytime. Plzz do something...ðŸ™"
I cant see video of others
Goood
Aa thuuðŸ˜
Improve its audio quality
This app is good for meeting but so many problems in meetings.only 2 star app
"This is half bad and half good, the good on this app is you can communicate with your friends, family, your job, and other persons... and the bad on this app is when i'm trying to join a meeting the loading screen ain't stopping even i have a strong connection and another this app sometimes kick me out while I'm on the meeting and i can't join to that room again i tried it multiple times but nothing is happening all i can see is just the loading screen its not stopping. Please fix it."
2 because my classmates can't see my camera... and i can't even see the presentation of my teacher and classmates i only letter j...can you fix this?
The network here is very poor
this thing takes too much space
"Firstly it was working well but after some time right when I join the meeting it shows that unfortunately,meet had stopped it has done this a thousand times now and because of this I am not able to join my class .ðŸ˜  Please do something"
ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
I will be very pixelated from the point of view of others
"This app is very good for my online class but when I join in our conference,the rate star always appeared even if I rate it"
"APP ALWAYS crash,turn white,laggy,blurry and it's very confusing"
Should have the one you can minimize the size and do the other things while also seeing what's on the call.
This is a Video Calling App but there is No Option to see all the people together.There must be Grid View Option for this.The app doesn't support bluetooth speaker. Is it because of many people chat together at the same time?There is also sound problem while using earphone.No Option to Save Meeting Links for further use.
"Scummy App, it uses the microphone if permission is allowed even though the mic in the App itself is turned off. Expected from Google I guess."
I can't run this app background
Video quality is low
Can't start recording from app
The only boring point is that we have to keep adding people manually all the time they get in. Please remove this feature. people get tired waiting to be accepted in the group everytime they accidentally leaves. Make it like zoom where we can join anytime whenever we are free.
When someone presents a screen so we can't roted that sceen so please add a option to we can roted the screen.
"It's a good app but there is a problem, in the middle of class it tells to rate the app and I can't see the class."
I don't like this app at all sometimes I cannot join a meeting if I don't join it at the exact time . It is digusting.And it takes a lot of time to rejoin it because sometimes it is of half an hour the meeting is over.
Problem audio not clear
Whenever I cliked on link it shows that failed to join meeting .I tried several times but it is showing the same.I uninstall and install the app many time but the same thing is showing again and again .thiis is happening from last few days first it was working well.pls help me to sort out this. Thank u
Not badðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
Actually I am student. When I am on my classes why you claim that rate this app by this I loss my connection with my class. By this I can't get important points by my teachers. Please set this problem. With this problem I can't give 5 stars

Hye there..I'm a student using this app..overall its good to use for my classes..but I'm disappointed. We students are using google meet to present our presentation and need to record the meeting for our evidence and submission of our project but the main problem is we can't record the meeting. Hope you can fix this problem.
Need some improvements. there are some major problems 1. Experiencing a huge amount of data loss. 2. Need more quality at less data usage. so please make a new option to increase and to decrease the video quality for saving the data.
App frequently gives trouble even good network
Cool
Good ðŸ˜…
I'm trying to install it but it is not installing ...what to do please tell
Not so good
The voice is not good
Bad
When im screen recoding i cant here the audio when im watching the screen recording other wise the app is good
"I think this app needs some developments. It is good but has some major issues while in meeting. I have a problem that is as soon as I touch the meeting URL, my mobile data goes off. And I have issues in joining meetings. It says like ""No such meeting"" while my colleagues are in that already. It will be nice if you fix it."
Only difficulty is that it canâ€™t take attendence.
Hi this app is good but in this app major problem is star rate if star rate comes we click good bad not now any options in this it will come back from meeting so this is problem that we are facing don't send star rate
This app can't support hd quality video call from laptop or computer... that's why I have face a lot of problem...I can't see the person who teach us... can't see what he writing on the which is very important to me..I can see only presentation which not so important to me... please do something..
It uses lot of data I was doing my tution classes and in 40 min it used 800 mb of data which is quite expensive. Pls do something .. I am sure developers will look into it . I am not sure my review will reach to them . Pls do something .....
Unsatisfactory. I have been having issues with this app for the past week. I can't see the presenter at all it's showing a blank screen. The teacher is the only one pinned but she doesn't show up. Everyone else can see and hear her. It's not my connection. 5 students in a class and I can't see her. I checked settings and there's nothing in that. Help!
why meet is combined mail in my phone its now opening with mail not with app this is really frustrating if it is opening in mail fullscreen mode is not available. app is far more better than mail.............. It would be better if gmail will provide fullscreen mode as meet is providing
"if I tap on the link to join Google meet By default it opens in Gmail (which I don't want to happen) I want it to open in Google meet app. I can't set it to open the link in the Google meet app by default (if there is a option please tell me), Or atleast tell me how to disable meet in gmail so that the only way for it to open is through this app. It irritates me to paste link every time in Google chrome (android) to get it to open in meet app."
It is a very beautiful& fast. But sometime from the app no sound hear.
Whenever i open the app . it shows meet is stopped ... I tried both the ways but too it shows the same thing ..again
I need this app for some works because it very useful. The network is good for downloading but can't download is there something wrong in my phone.
Consumes too much data.. And also need auto rotate system please.. Google Meet please.. Need auto rotate system
Good app but can be improve if the coder edit one function in this app that there must be an option of Private chat and group chat just like in Zoom and Microsoft Teams and there is not any option of Hold meeting by this any call come meeting must be on hold but the meeting was end .... My Half-yearly's are going to held through this app and I faces network issues daily during online classes and I don't how I adjust ... Thanks ðŸŒ¸
Ok aap

"I can't open any meeting link from the Meet App. It was working fine even yesterday! But from my laptop, from Meet website, everything works okay."
The app is good but it consume more net as my 11 std onilne classes are starting and the lectures are for 5 hours and it can over my data so how to use it by minimising data
Bsdk teri vjh se online classes lgani pd rhi h tb de rha hu tuje 2 star agar tu bndo ki limit 2-4 krde to m tujhe 5 star dunga or apne dosto se 5 star karvauga ... Bol krega!!
I couldn't speak with my Bluetooth headphone.I could hear the audio but if I speak the listeners couldn't hear. So please could u do me the needful
There should be option of raising hand for participants. And also there should be numerical number infront of participants to know who raised hand first.
Audio couldnot shared from mobile Only video can be shared
It is good but sometimes the video and voice is not clearly
"Even after clearing cache and restarting my phone the app still keeps on crashing, and when I'm in landscape mode if I attempt to pin another person the app crashes."
Uses too much data..no settings available to adjust video resolution..plzzzzz fix the data draining issue.
"From few days, If I minimize google meet and open other app ,After few time I can't hear anything and I am disconnected from meeting automatically.Is this is update issue ? Today I updated Google meet."
"I don't know why it's integrated with meet feature in gmail app, if I click a link for Google meet meeting, it opens directly in gmail app's meet mode even though I have Google meet app installed(then why meet app needed for?) and it's interface clearly differs from gmeet which is not as convenient as it is in Google meet. I suggest that there should be an option to choose in which app I want to attend the Google meeting such as if it's in gmail / gmeet / browser. It needs to be fixed A.S.A.P."
Best
It is not downloading for me ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜£

Gd
From 2-3 days whenever i click on any meeting link the google meet app doesn't get startes instead the meeting is opened in gmail. What's the problem going on i can't sort out and its really irritating.
Personal chat should be added
Still after update not more than 100 members can join the meeting
Good
Everytime i join or create a meeting its always getting into unfortunately stop...... I tried a couple of times already and its always been the same
OK cool thanks
This app is better
Nice
Recording option is not available
Unlock the meeting room. Each time a person joins needs to ask permission. Recording option not available.
Be bring back the old meet..... this meet is too bad
Super
Good app
It need more improvment video is not clear and audio is delayed.
Video and voice some time breaking
When I join a meeting it stucked and I can only hear voice of my friends...I cant see the face and cant see the screen they present..
Video and audio quality poor...
Ok ok type
Sometimes I can't see others video.the screen becomes white
The app is nice not so perfect and not so bad
Opppp
Zoom app provide more options than Google meet. I think google will take a year to come up with options like Zoom.......
The app is good but it have very network problem
Well it dosen't shows any difference it seems that we are working on the zoom only .
"Most of the time i face problem, some camera does not work, some time vice quality is low."
Haven't used it yet but I'm going to.
User interface is worst ever. You cannot use this app on the go totally. It does not work on lock screen. It doesn't change loud speaker to ear automatically. It has buttons like mute/camera always hidden. It has stupid rotation of screen. Everything what is possible done wrong. But the quality is good.
This is a good app for metting
It glitches out a lot
Not bad
It is very nice application but I am facing problem while presenting my screen because as I am Teacher and my school is using it for online classes so whenever I present my screen my students start presenting there screen which causes so much disturbance.
"NEW PROBLEM-every time we recieve a call the video and audio turned off. Worst video quality and high net consuming. Settings isn't good. We must turn off audio and video in setting. Why I can't see all video in gallery view? Update it. Please improve settings section. When my mobile is in portrait mode ,full video can't be seen . Please look into this issue. Otherwise, it deserves 5 star rating.â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º"
"If I answer any call during a meeting, I have to re-enter the meeting again...fix this"
Not so good because when i want to other open other app without lefting the meeting i will automatically left the class. Pls resolve this problem
ðŸ‘
It uses lot of internet for meeting in this app so i give two stars â­â­to this app and in this app the host has no value because anyone can enter automatically and i lastly want that please update the app to make it like zoom app
Ppp
I can at ones that if everyones video is on or off.
"Not so great on chromebooks, but works perfectly on iPads. Could use quite a few updates so the host is able to mute/un-mute or pin/un-pin screens"
This app is the reason I could not enjoy my quarantine because of the online classes..
Very poor app (not good) because of problem of strength after 105 people joins not other people join the meeting this is feedback from the teachers for online class.please goole improve the strength I give 2 stars because of this problem if you improve this problem I give 5 stars and give good feedback. Thankyou
Okkk
Sometime it does not work
Well other features are fair enough whereas the captions are extremely horrible even after updating the app .....and one cannot take a call when in a meetðŸ˜‘
Not bad
"They should enhance their features like adding a co- host, control of who can present their screen and switching off the videos of participants. These features should be there for hosts as it becomes difficult to handle a webinar"
Audio n vedio both are not clear and rate us option will disturb meeting every time
I can't talk
I am Having Good Experience With GOOGLE MEET. But I request to The team GOOGLE. It will be more convenient for us if you bring an Update to share our screen along with the internal sound during the meeting. . This feature will absolutely will mean a lot for us.....
Every time when I click on a meeting link it stucked and showing only google meet logo on screen. I've to wait for several minutes to fix. But many times it yet not solved. I have to clear cache file or whole data to fix it. Every single time I faced this problem. It makes very dissapoint to get such service from Google originated product. Pls try to resolve it. Thank you.
Super...

Dharshni Girinath Super
I can't use it on my phone
I cannot se e the screen
Everything bad
Its not good it takes lot of time to open ðŸ˜¡
Cannont elaborate signal when call comes it automatically goes to poor network conditions
Its nice but not that great. First of all we cannot chat privately. Secondly there is no video symbol that tells us that the person has turned on video or not. Third reason is that we cannot see the full person in portrait mode on mobile phone. Please work on them.
I am facing problem failed to join meeting so I kindly request to to solve this problem
It doesnt had personal chats
"I don't know the reason I could join a single meeting whenever I click join the internet automatically off and disconnect from the meeting,I tried restarting and reinstalling but nothing worked,it worked fine before the previous update."

Please do something for thia problem. Thank you"
There is a certain problem with the joining of the link . One more fault is after doing the update it is not working properly and not responding as well . Please take a look at that section. And also ensure me that how many people can join the video meeting???
No more than 100 people can come to it
Not good

"It is a nice app for meetings and classes but the problem is it sometimes lags very much (I have faced that), sometimes when you tilt your screen landscape to portrait it stucks and the whole screen turns black and I can only hear others voice. And at that time when I try to exit the meeting and rejoin, I was not even able to find the button for that (it disappeard and I have faced it for many times). And one of my friends were not even able to join the classes."
Nice

When people are leaving the meeting the message that shows it comes in top of chat box and one can't even type until the whole message disappears. Need to fix this

Not so much better because some time sarver getting very slow video display not so much better
6k
My app is not working properly please co-operate the app
Very bad app because of sound
Google mettings do not allow me to use the web version and instead forces me to use this app. Completely horrible!
I couldn't listen me
There should be a feature like zoom that the host can remove anybody and the host has to admit students and without permission no one can share screen po
"The app is good but the name is from google account that is very disturbing , if there is an option that we change name but not from google account then it's really nice app."
The video quality is very poor. It is inable to indentify what is showing on the screen or lecture attended even after providing good internet. I suggest you to provide the option of video quality to choose for the users so that they can choose as per their connection.
I can't see the screen when host use their camera plz improve it
Nice app
"Every thing is ok, but the subtitle feature is totally fake."
Neither I have old device nor I have low strength network
Bad
Your rating system gets in the way when having a meeting that's why I'm rating now and drains lots of data from your phone
Mabagal haha
Keep seing static on others presentations
Bakwas
Split screen is not working on me.
Please have a feature to allow users to schedule a meeting through the app instead of using the desktop google calendar to do so.
Parpadea la pantalla en video llamada
Super unreliable. Not user friendly. Too complicated specially for students. Needs lots of extensions to work. Zoom is still better
My microphone and camera are not working
When someone sent me a link from messenger and when I pressed it says FAILED TO JOIN.It always happen.Do you have any idea on how to fix it?Thanks
Private chat is not thereðŸ˜“
Network issues
"Audio is average, and video clarity is horrible. The video breaks up every minute. Screen presentation is good, so I gave 2 stars."
Works a quarter of the time doesn't work the rest. Wth.
good app
Keeps lagging
This ruined my lockdown life by my teachers ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿso try to avoid this appðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ .....btw all the best for online classes ðŸ˜€..but the app is good..
It is a very useful app for student s and for employers and tq for this app
Every time video is blur and voice is not clear
This app is not i want to 4 people in one time and full screen like zoom and too much sound echo the video was not clear
High consumption of data
"When I try to open the Google meeting link sent through whatsapp groups , it directly forwards me to Gmail and opens it there , instead of Google meet App . Please solve it"
"We can't share pdf , photo, documents Always share a mobile screen it is irritating ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ We can't use full screen Always we have rotate mobile then full screen see ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ Leave meeting is so near to mute / unmute button and video botton and when we touch leave meeting option then they automatically exit in meeting update this and ask for exit in meeting Update fast Please ðŸ™"
It's a better app to hold a meeting but the most worse thing that I have seen that is it take more data in a fraction of second. And so much....
Vedio and audio is not perfact
there was many hacker in this
This is good... but I am getting a problem to scroll chats and participates name in my pc... please fix this problem...
I am getting a Network problem while using this app
Need much more improvement ðŸ˜¶
Very net consuming
Ok
Good App
Add split screen support and more settings for 5 stars
"The app is good but it need a great network coverage owthewise it will stop automatically It is main problem i faced during attending my online class and and the caption is worst so, i hope you will impovre it in the next updates Thank you."
Does not work for my other gmail
Video and audio is not clear
not bad not good
Good
Faced error joing the meeting
Very worst app Because It again again stuck during meeting and the app ask to rating then the app is closed
It was very bad And it was not secure
If anyone joins or leaves the meeting the notification appears on the typing area. The other entire screen is useful at that point of time. So if you can move the notification anywhere on screen not on the typing area It would be extremely helpful for people who need to type constantly on mobile devices. Students all across India are using Google Meet and this the problem for every student.
Screen of Google meet is too short ðŸ˜”
Thise app is good
Sometime it does not join properly and once it get joined then it always close after a few seconds It creates a lot of problem for me
Very bad experience! Controls are very silly and bad. The security is not there anybody can see your off video also. I Request to the app developers please fix these problems. This app is directly linked to your Google account which is not good. At the end this is very bad online meeting app. This is not good â˜¹ï¸
Nice
It uses huge amount of mobile data. ..
Why is there no option to enter meeting without host permission
Not so much features....plzz improvement is needed
Improve in screen visibility and captions ..... Pls improve and attendance no need remove the attendance process.. I hate it
It consumes too much internet in 3 hour of my class 1 Gb /day I'm getting that finished in 3 hour
App is good but it consumes lot of data if l compare it to zoom
When i open the app it will open then close open then close
While I am in class on Google meet and when I off rotation lock and turned the phone sometime it gone totally white so thats why I can't see full screen and second thing sometimes I leave class automatically and when I zoom the screen sometimes it is white . I leave and join back but after sometime the same thing again occur
"Very bad, everytime I try to join the class, it shows failed to enter try again, then I have to uninstall it thn install it again thn I m able to enter. Do something about this. Tell me how to fix this issue"
Some time it causes problems in joining showing that fail to join meeting but it is very helpful
"When I join the class I can't able to see others only voice can hear,it's look whitishand it suddenly remove from meeting and ask to rate the app"
This app is worst .the caption is not working well if they say strange it is saying trained pls check and correct it
This app is Good bt is should have more security settings. We can't find the email id of the person who use it is causing many problems in our class.
Nice app but not satisfied .
My recording service not working in my device
"This app does not start only on my android tablet. Whenever the meeting starts it comes like "" unfortunatly meet has stoped "" . well meet starts on all other devices. And all other new version apps starts on my tab."
This is too bad app. clarity was too bad & the audio was very pooor
This app is not working properly Its show no such meeting
Very bad application as the data usage is more and more in 2 hours 1.5 gb gets completed i prefer the developer of this application to remove bug from this application
"I already done review but ...I will write another one ---> 1)I have send them feedback so many times but no improvement / response . 2)Atleast do something about recording session ( show some option like LINK OF RECORDING or RECORDING to all participants/members ) , which will be easy to get recording without begging to host to give recorded video."
Good
"Drains more battery and very much poor quality of video presentation, mostly blurry"
"It got stuck in between ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ Becoz of this im unable to attend my online classes and it show again and again ""MEET HAS STOPED WORKING"" im unable to listen classes ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ fix this problem Plzzz"
Darkmode??
I gave it 2 stars because it doesn't have private chat box to ask students questions privately then the other students can't see the answers. Please add this. In next update. please add this.
Over network gone
"My microphone abruptly stops when I use Google meet. Over all its a nice app but it keeps stopping and even when I leave the class ita always on even though I remove it from ""recent apps used"". Please fix this bug. It's annoying"
"Noise is a big issue with this app. Every day in my work meetings, 1 person sounds like he is submerged in water, another one's distant noise too I can hear, clarity and echo too is still there. Are you working on it or bot guys? Zoom feels better."
I can't used it to my Huawei nova 7i device. Any suggestions to install it in my device please ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ I really need this app for my online class. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜°
"This app is working very badly. There are many problems in it like others have posted .. the most bad thing is the caption ...I m telling yes sir ,it is writing listening.... So after update if there's any problem I will post later"
If there is network also the app will will exit the meeting...and always askes reviews which is really disturbing...I am sorry for this but on option....
â˜¹ï¸
Amazing app
"Why Does the app closes on hitting back button,or back gesture.... like its a meeting app who else click back to exit the meeting... You could made atleast confirmation from user whether he want to exit.."
I have an issue sometimes my app was not open quickly in high speed of internet
Kusang nageexit kapag nasa meeting kainis
Net bohot hi tezz jaata hai 2 hr ke andar 1.5 gb chal jaata in zoom utni der me 200 mb chlta with video on ðŸ˜’ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
Dont give to much popup of giving riview . If we are interested than we surely give u that. Hope ur team will get that .
This app is lagging too much.some times it is saying failed to join meeting and in between of the meeting the device is hanging and saying meet is not responding eventhough the internet connection is good.because of these problems I had to quit the meetings in between
Very waste hangs a lot
"During video call, my camera view is so dark which actually works fine in other applications. Can you please guide on this? I am using Acer One 7 4G Tab. Thanks..!!"
Nice app
The data is going so fast
Please add privite chat in meet
Sound is not clear
Plzz add the split screen mode here
Not good
Please Introduce delete option for the chat section of the meet....
Some times meeting take lot of time to join and meeting take only 100 participents
ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š
Consumes huge data
I know this app is really good. But now I can't attend any meeting . Please help me . Its a great issue . Please help me.
This app is very much helpful this is best app
It is more efficient than other live class app but consume far more data. As it many time consume about 600 mb of data in just 45 minutes. Leaving nothing for other classes.
Good app
This app is very good but problem is we join meeting only one time then when our network is slow meeting can't join
very good app
Guna
It is very hard to use It is more than 4 times it not working And Also rotating option is not working And it is using more data also I am expecting that u will improve Thank you
Mast
I can't attend any meetings. I tried many times but I can't join the meeting. What is the solution of problem.
"Stop asking audio quality feedback in middle of class meeting.... after feedback it directly quits the application...like seriously ,today in my class google meet has asked audio quality feedback many times...once or twice is okay...but 4-5 times...i feel so irritated to rejoin again and again... it asks me audio quality feedback...and quits application without my permission... please fix this soon as possible"
"It has some problem whenever I join meeting it is showing ""failed to join meeting"" please fix this problem"
Will be be better if support screen recording
"I'm unable to share screen , before I was able to but this app got deleted & now I'm unable to share screen please fix it"
"Well, it works somewhat on app but what is problem with pc, laptop... audio lags behind.. and there isnt any sink.. audio elongates.. There are problems with app too.. this audio and video doesn't sink.. There are times when presentation is not visible.. and sometimes it happens with video too ... Leaving this, the meet doesn't even work on my laptop the camera doesn't work.. and audio will not be proper...It is better on app when compared to it. Pls try to sort it out and clear it."
Notifications of people leaving and joining completely blocks the send button on the chat. I'm completely cut off at the end of the meeting when most people leave. Edit: I did do once as you said. A week or so ago. Thanks. Pls fix it soon.
This app is not good because it takes too much time in joining
Google come on.i tried everything.but it says failed to foin meeting.what the hell is it.pls resolve this problem
"Only the host video is always white in colour, while the others are visible ."
It is consuming too much data . My net got exhausted.
Best app
It is a very bad app. Sometimes when I am doing online class the sound is cracking.
When I pin video my screen is full white please solve this issue
"""How is audio and video"" this was coming many times and automatically left the meetting again and again what will i do?"
Good things in Google meet app are this app is working in video call or in conference we are doing or they are doing well but in that thing it is working well done if now we will see bad thing bad thing is that while class is going on that time we can't record the voice of what we are saying that is very very bad thing so I will cut 3 marks in that............................................
This app contains so many bugs ... Sometimes i am not able to hear anyone and sometimes my mic doesn't workk ..... Fix it .. or please add recording meeting options in phone meet also ...
Good app but it has many of the bugs â˜¹ï¸ðŸ™
"This is good but i have many complaints in it in short, if we are talking or joining classes or meetings for school and other it is not very good"
"Although the app is good but somehow it's faulty and has a bug, whenever I want to join a meeting it shows failed to join a meeting but when ever I join the same link by Chrome or some other browser it works perfectly, I think there's some sort of glitch in the app, so please see to it"
Vedio is not clear all time blurring. Sound is also not clear
There needs to be an option that disables the mute/ camera tray from auto-hiding. It is extremely frustrating for my kindergarten child .
It incurrs alot of data
very nice to attend class
I like this app
It's doesn't support splits screen plz improve
"I was in the middle of the class and this app suddenly crashed. I uninstalled and installed it several times. But the message""Failed to join meeting"" kept popping up."
Can't see vedio.
Extremely laggy unlike the web version on desktop.
Mic glitch is still happening sometimes
A lot of issues like when I join a meeting it shows that 2 accounts are logged in .
IT using to much data For only 1 hr it take 800 MB Please make IT go slow I don't like these app ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡
The voice lag too much
"Most of the mic is not properly working.Also sometimes it shows that ""failed to join "" while trying to join the meeting"
Whenever I try to open the app but it continuously shows ' failed to login ' Many of my online class is being disturbed by that also Please make sure that the app will be correct as soon as possible......
Inconsistent.
Good
Video quality is bad.please improve this
Okay but it consumes more data & a little network fluctuation leads to disturbance in audio video case
While in Google meet if any case the phone rings and when i pick the phone call . suddenly the meeting has ended and just when i touch back sign suddenly the meeting had ended so these things should improved .
"The video conference lags even with 100 mbps on both sides on same wifi, the screen is half wasted in portrait mode. The screen should show as many video screens on single screen in both landscape & portrait mode and be scrollable to view others on the meet (chk Teams). Since its Google, Cast icon should be available to use phone only as microphone. Ease of use wth as many features should be the agenda."
"The last time I use this, it is working but not the app keep force stopping"
When i try to join a meeting it will suddenly crash . Even when i try to create a link . It constantly crash
Meet was not working properly. There was an echo and video clearity is not good
Add multi window option
Normal
In this meet I don't hear other voice and in the meeting automatically ended .
Every time I have my physic class i am not able to see the teacher and what she is showing in the board. I can only see a white blank screen. Can you help me know how to correct this problem because if i dont see what they r teaching then I won't be able to understand what they are teaching

My microphone is not work . In google class meet and no one can hear me .
Had a good experience. Good video quality. But the network usage needs to be optimised. I suggest adding video quality options.
App is consuming a lot of data after updating the new version
App is nice to quickly create a meeting call. App have issue. If a meeting going on and minimize app after that click from home icon disconnect from the previous meet and screen ask for new meeting or rejoin.
Wanted to rate 5 stars for its UI and features but when you rotate your mobile screen you can't see the presentation then it shows profile pic and that's a big problemâš ï¸

"I like the security system that was made by the administration of Google meet. But in my opinion, I think, it must be a option of host making. It must contain the option to make host to others. Because, sometime host being busy in that situation other co-host add others from outside. But the app is quite good."
Well well this time it stays for some min and then crash's. what is happening. another thing I noticed when I deleted meet I downloaded it again from play store it downloaded I a sec and the installation was not even processed I don't have fast internet and high android how in the world the download was completed I a sec.pls answer

Nice
1st day it works well but after that it stops working in my phone even i reinstalled it many times and tried but it doesn't work even internet connection in nice and no background apps are running which cause me to use my gaurdians phone and installed it
"Very frustrating and bad experience. When you work on another app while the meeting is on, and then after sometime when you come back to WRITE SOMETHING URGENTLY , then it keeps you telling whoever has exit the meeting, on the text bar!!! So you have to wait minutes before you can send the message. It should be anywhere except the text bar."
The audio is not audible but the sensor is runnig why . And..... We need dark mode .. because it may be not harmful as much as ordinary theme
It is impossible to send voice message in whatsapp when meet in recording
Today I didn't received any option to present screen. What should I do??
This app ask for rating 10 times when meeting is on and after that the meeting is left automatically plz change this problem because it distrib alot

They can make phone audio for Indian numbers in app the can make sure about this I tried to make phone audio but it was not coming. So they can make this feature in next update..................
Screen is small for the person who has organized the meeting. No volume available for video sharing in mobile up till now.

network essu
Nah
"This app keeps on crahing.. whenever there are multiple users speaking during meeting. Video even freezes. I am not seeing any system requirements, I assume this should be working on every Android OS version. Mybtablet even has very low memory usage.. i kept on clearing cache and data but it still keeps on crashing.. ðŸ˜‘"
"It serves it is purpose, but sometimes when I enter into the meet with my pc as well as my phone it give some kind of fluctuating buzzing noise when I use my phone for audio and pc for presenting from the same account... Sometimes it even makes others incapable to listen to what I'm saying ... I have also felt other audio related bug when more than 4 people turn on the microphone... These stuff above are felt by a lot of people and your support doesn't give a clear answer to a lot more problems."
Video is not clear and audio is also not nice pls check out that
ðŸ˜‚
"Worked alright at first. Then, for some reason, it just kicked me out and then when i tried to rejoin it said: ""no such meeting"" when there were people still talking on it. Couldn't rejoin. Wouldn't use it again"
Plz keep private chat option also like zoom . Zoom is better than Google meet ðŸ¤¬
"I cant get into meeting , google meet said the time is unfournatly stopped , when i was join in meeting , again i got same thing only , i cant join my meeting ,"
It does not split the screen
It's showing high resource consumption every time I have reinstalled it also but after some days it start showing it again
_s
Wz
Best app for the meeting.
Easy and it's convenient as well
Not like zoom
Good
There was a echo
"Hello, i want to say...I've some problem in it......when I'm join my classes it wants feedback from me.....if i give them 5 stars then I'll back from my class and when I'm rejoined my classes they said thankyou for your feedback and after some times it again wants feedback ""How's your audio and Video""....And when i clicked 'not now' Again I'm back from my class....in that situation What can i do....can you help me....i missed 5 classes for that problem......please help me!"
"Google meet is nice app for online studies but in some condition it is worst too because when I attended my online classes , the video goes blurring and I am not seeing anything properly and the voice and the sound was breaking up also ...."

Cr
Not user friendly like zoom.
Voice is not audible
Why is the Google app exiting often ?
I suggest to you give some more features as zoom gives.
Please fix the issue of video quality and overall quality and experience like professionals meeting or chats and fix the issue of audio quality to a greater extent. I am very disappointed and disgusted with these things. Honestly. Thank you.
Uses much data
Kindly resolve my problem When I join google meet then my tablet camera gets off when I go on any another screen even meet is going on.plz resolve issue as online paper is going to start
Poor ui
Can you people just enable g meet for multi window or split screen
"Googlemeet is really good app but,Google meet doesn't work properly from last two days . When I join my class of math the total screen becomes only white . Only white appearance came in screen when I join the class .my friends also facing this problem .in such situations we only here audio we doesn't able to see the screen because only white appearance came in screen .so please fixed this problem.

This app is useless. There is no time limit for the class the teachers sometimes continue the class for 2 hrs and that sucks.
Send message while someone leaving is tedious cuz leaving message appears in the same place
Audio was breaking
Who to download to 3 g phone
"Because my voice is not clear to anyone and my screen is also not clear My class not join in one try . Class join but others voice is not coming ,meet want stars.

"When I at the meeting, suddenly there's notification about the app to rate the app, and that's make me angry"
Sometimes it is not working
Microphone is not working properly
Fine

If others don't update with whom you are meeting you won't be able to add more than 100 and also can't chat with someone else personally or a single person without letting the others knowing(I am a student)
Nice app but when uptade comes it will not work properly 1 week 2 week uptade will come again 1 week 2 week uptade will come and google meet don't remind us and I have to check in play store when my class starts 5 6 minutes waste in update and teacher don't allow me in meeting. If google meet remind us with notification so I will uptade it in free time and it will become easy.
This app isn't displaying the quality video for the customer of bsnl like 3g users and LTE users so you guys can improve the quality of the video by using less internet connection.
It is very useful to me and very helpful to me.
Not expected from google meet.. Daily I am not at all able to join my class.
This is good but not very good
"I can't see anything on the screen. Everything looks white. Since I use meet for class,,I am having a lot of problems.......I uninstall it and reinstall it....but the problem was not fixed....."
Hang app this is

And please solve my problem. And at last I only want to say that this problem is faced by me only , my no other classmates get this problem"
I gave 2 stars because we can't chat separately with the teachers. Sometimes I even can't see the teachers. Once I was 3 periods late and the teachers scolded me. ðŸ™ This app is worst. Sometimes I also get disconnected from meet and also have problems to rejoin ðŸ˜”. Sometimes I even cant get my audio on and the teachers say that it's a lie. Can you please repair this app.

Even when the host changed many meeting ids, Still its continuing. When I checked with my friends, most of them were able to see the video clearly. I wonder why this is happening only to a few people. We are suffering a lot because of this. Pls try to solve this issue as early as possible."

There is an echo everytime I start to speak and it grows with time
â¤â¤
Very bad sometimes..
Nowadays most of the schools and colleges are using google meet for online classes . This app has a major flaw . The one student who joins the google meet earliest except the administrator can remove or can mute any student in the meeting . Through this many students are being removed by a single student and then it is being showed you have been removed by someone . The students who are removed from the meet cannot rejoin using the same email id . Pls resolve this issue .
Good

Good app meetings are easy with this app
Nice but her sound problem
While at the online class suddenly the app doesn't work . It ask me to tell about the video and audio presentations. I was just irritated with this . Please ignore this
"Google meet works perfectly on pc! No problems with audio, video or presentation. But it uses up alot of mobile data. And in mobile or tablet, this app is really inconvinent. It takes up a lot of space as well as battery. Within 20mins the phones battery can go from 100% to 40% even if this app is running on the background. It heats up the phone pretty fast and after quite some time the app stops working. It gets difficult to join the meeting and to use the app. But in pc, it works fine so far."
"The new update is not that good! No full screen mode available! And notifications are annoying in middle about others! Totally the update is not good in Google apps! And I like Google llc responding to my review! Hope a new update releases with full screen mode, and without annoying notifications about other person's joined and leaving!"
It is not good app for meeting i only got 1/2classes on this app
It's a humble request to please bring an update that we can block student I'd on Google Meet and he or she can't see my messages and camera
This is good app but unfortunately meet has stopped

"This google meet app is so good and easy to work. But the problem is when my online class is going on then "" rate the app"" this option comes again and again so i give rating 2 to 3 times but it cannot stop and my class disconnect . And then I cannot connect to my class again . Therefore i give this app 3 stars . I wanna say that fix this app . Feedback option does not open when rating option comes, that's why I am not able to send you feedback"
ðŸ‘Œ
Some times the message bar is not appearing
Can I send two inviting links for the same meeting
I recently updated Meet...and now the settings have changed. New messages don't pop up instead I have to keep on scrolling them down to look for new messages. Please fix this... I liked the older setup.
It's a very good app but they should give a personal chat feature also because as a student I'm attainding online classes so we have so many questions but we can't always ask all questions to teacher or on everyone chat otherwise they'll be disturb so if we have a personal chat option then we can simply ask questions to our friends it's my huge request to have a personal chat option .
This experience is very bad because of that in this app there as asking RATE US it will comes again and again repeatedly comes more times for that only I was it this is very bad experience. Please stop that rating here after it not to be come while ok am in the online class
l've problem with your latest update . it's really . Confusing and inconvenient to use . The earlier format /interfere was far hettev
"Everytime I want to type something, when someone leaves the meeting, the notification blocked the send icon"
"Iam using this app my online classes. So, thanks for this app. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€"
Good but some time what happened of Google meet.. I don't understand
In my google meet chat box is not coming. Please fix the problem
This app is really good for social networking.But some of the features have to add with it like zoom.
Video not clear in fast internet
In Google Meet not only the meeting beginner but also the joining members also have the facilities to join another member. Who can't join on time or late by his some other work and the beginner may not see his/her joining notification. I use it as to attend my online classes. It is a good platform to join many people at a time. If u want to talk to your all family members at a time.
now it is okay

"The new update is less user friendly. We can't see the messages easily. We can't change the screen easily. Google, please look into it. Plsss..."
Super
Better
"Works fine for classes , but when after a while I try to switch on the mic, it just doesn't respond. And I have to restart the app and re-join the meeting"
"If you are naming this app as 'meeting', there should be some functionality for presenter to mute all participants, otherwise i would have given 5 stars"

"Please add a personal message reply feature , so that anyone can talk privaty"

Everything is alright but only thing I am facing is the voice of others......the other's voice keeps on breaking even though they don't have connectivity issues....... You must need to fix the voice breaking communications in meet even for slow speed internet users.....
From past few days..the network issues have increased
Please make it a paid app. So we can skip our online classes.
Previous interface was user friendly the present update is not much friendly also even if camera and microphone is turned off this app consumes battery too much
PLEASE ADD VIDEO QUALITY FEATURES LIKE PC VERSION AND NEED SOME IMPROVEMENTS. ðŸ˜¡
I am using this app for my online classes but from some days I am facing a problem that the audio and video are coming clear but then sudden everything stops and after sometimes it leaves me from the meeting and then when I try to join again it shows failed to join
Video quality not good and voice used to crack...... It gives a very lazy response....I prefer to use other app....
Good and anytime voice breaking
Please give blur background in android
No reviewsðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨
A very good app but it's lots of data
"Have been using the app since last April. However discontinued due to some problems. 1. Recording and other host provisions are still not available in the mobile app. 2. Automatically exiting the app without any reason. Creating a lot of problem during online classes. 3. Bad audio quality, even when there is no network issues and where other video conferencing apps work fine."

Good
From the day I have installed the app the app was running well but from four days back each meeting has video and audio issues. Although I don't have any network issue as the whatsApp video calls are running well. Please check.
Good!! But I am not satisfied with its video quality nd audio sometime I can't hear
The application is very goodðŸ‘. Please add manual landscape mode. It will be really helpful for me.
Should we pay money for meet
I like the old version. The new one can't split the screen with messg box and people. ðŸ˜ž
"I had a problem, that I download google meet for my online class, but now it turn into gmail. So that, I can't attend my classes continuously. It always asks me to give feedback on that. When I give that, it automatically comes out. I don't know why it happens like that ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢"
I am facing an issue..... Whenever I open my camera in the app automatically shut down. And also when two or more people open their cameras then also I am not able to attend the meeting. Then also it shut down . But there is no network problem..
This is going but what will be when you add private chat on this app
Nice
Good
Now from one to two because you are improving better and better good okk thanks for review me ...you are improving when I got perfectness I will give you five star...one that is that we are only able to see first four people image and unable to see the left only host can see the other ..please do it for all ...
Good app
This app is great but please add a dark mode because I cant stand my eyes burning for 2 hours doing my assignment
"It was a very good app and I attend my classes with this app but sometimes the teacher will have onned the camera and others could see her but only a white screen is visible for my device. I'm very unhappy with this issue and I can't understand what teacher is explaining or writing. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled but it does not work. I have also cleared storage and cache but also this issue continues. I need this issue to be resolved immediately!! Regards, Google meet user"
"The app is very good but is missing some features, these are-) 1. Private chat while meetings-) Not always everything can be discussed openly. 2. Graphics settings 3. Sending photos and audios during video-) This is very important."
it was very bad
When I just take anyonther apps my video will be closed automatically and audio is just cutting other than these faults everything is good in Google meet
I am not able to present my screen with the people amd there is no option of present screen in options
Nive app but its always has network problem and need to do improvements in this app..
"Good app but i face some prblms in offing and oning the mic and camera it's always written try another page ... I am really fed of this ,, in phone it works well but in pc it doesn't work at all plzz make sure that google meet should have all features .."
my mic doeant work when i using earphone
Good and nice app
Please add delete chat option in chat box. It is very important
"great app, very easy to use. The thing is, i for some reason cant use the chat option on my iphone, but i can on my android! Very odd considering i have both in the latest update."
"Overall the app is nice. But the problem is with the chat box , whenever someone leaves the meeting than a message is delivered that someone's left. Then at that time we can't type or send any message in the chat box."
Useful
Voice quality
I cannot hear able to hear other voice ðŸ˜” please sir check it
Okay raman
Good but not very good ðŸ˜€ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜„
Nice app
My device is incompatible Pls make it work for me thnks.
"Ahaha, my teachers use this, it works flawlessly, but then you have the lag. It always makes the other tabs load even if I have spolight mode on, and my camera is always off too. Fix this problem, or I will tell my teachers and supervisors that we should move to zoom, which will in fact happen."
It's a great app but you should really include more options for phone devices like the grid View. Many people are working from the phones right now and for some of us it's impossible to afford a computer at this moment as a teacher I would find this really useful.
A very good application to communicate especially during this lock-down I am very thankful to the GOOGLE team There are some small issues in the application which can be fixed not a big deal
"The split screen is not working anymore after the update, i can't multi task now"
Good app
Can i know how do we cancel the background noises ? The app is Good but the voice breaks all the time.

Add option to admit multiple waiting users . Rather than admit one person at a time.
"Meet I your experienceâ¤ï¸ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’šðŸ’™ðŸ’œbut please don't stop my class is spoiling they will show ""Meet has stopped"" please meet don't stop"
"Please add ""change nickname"" so I may no longer need to change my name in Google Account. But I prefer to send it here.. :>"
"Good app ðŸ˜ƒ but there is one problem which is very distrubing . The problem is that when you press back button , meeting will end and it does have more options . According to this behaviour , Zoom is better and Zoom had more option comparing Google meet . Please solve this problem . I hope you will reply and mix this problem ðŸŒ¹."
"Ok ,not bad"
Please add delete my chat option in Google meet's chat section. Please consider this in your next update.
Please work on some that are on pc but not in mobile and work on presenting screen it is very alow to update even at high data speed
"Hi Google Meet Team, This app is good for students. You have done a great job. I have request that is please enable layout option in mobile. And to reply to my last review's answer.

The latest update is really awful. I can't join a meeting if I'm on a whatsapp call and even when I unmute people are unable to hear me speak. Earlier meet was a total blessing since it worked pretty good even if the connection is bad. But can't say the same about the latest update. Kindly go back to the older version please.
Actually good app for meeting but I always experience a lot of echo when using headphone or bluetooth. Without headphone voice is clear. Google LLC pls look into the problem.

"I've problem with your latest update. It's really confusing and inconvenient to use. The earlier format/interface was far better. You could have improved it but in a different way. Secondly your aap eats up so much mobile data, and uses up so much battery power while running in the background. Please Google look at your app reviews. It's (your app) worsening day by day. Fix the problems."

When I rejoin meeting it deletes chat history. It doesn't have private chat. So, I suggest you 3 things:- 1) Solve this network problem. 2) If I rejoin meeting don't erase chat history of that meeting. 3) Add private message setting."

"This app is really great but still lacks some features like recording a call,raise hand feature,mute all option,end meeting for all. This app is already secure and if these all features are available then this app will really be the best vedio conferincing app on playstore"
"The app is good for communicating in low bandwith. But it lacks some important features. They are- Recording option, background blur, and tiled view which are available in the web version. Other competitors already have these options. Moreover, noise cancellation can be improved."
Can we mute a induvisual personally

I mean the app is okay I use it for school but the glitches are so ðŸ…‘ðŸ…ðŸ…“ I wish they had a better one.
Very nice

"It acquires much internet during a meeting from a desktop or laptop Please made it such a way from which it acquires much less internet, before 1-2 month ago it acquires less internet. Beside this it is a good app for online meetings and classes."
"The app was good but i am unsatisfied with the latest version of this app , it is worst ! I am not able to control it properly. Even i can see the screen while typing the message . I need the old version back . Could you please tell how i will get my old versio."

N.
This app is good but sometimes the video is blurry.
"Good app,"

If you make a different chat box to every member of the meeting and in captions if people are telling something in bengali or hindi try to make the captions in that language
This app is very helpful but it is not working In my tab

Nice but in the middle of meeting it gets stuck and takes lot of time to refresh
Useful app
"Its good but, grid view like we have in zoom should be updated....then it would the best meeting app...try to bring it in the next update.."
Audio and Picture Quality is not good. Many times sound doesn't reach to other members in meeting . Screen gets freezed . Google team needs to fix these issues immediately .
the presentation when we share a time even on my laptop and on my phone too my all friends and teachers are able to share the presentation but its comes blur some time but the most worst thing is that there is no annotation or white board sharing and the feature which is not there is that there is no lock meeting feature or the waiting just you can do it by your company or school email which is paid but there should be a feature for the normal users too.There is on more reason for the disappointment is that when we press the back key of phone the gets closed and we get disconnect from the meeting.The reason that I am giving 3 stars is that it does not takes time to connect to the meeting while it takes in any other meeting app otherwise I would give 1 or 2 stars. please fix these problems s
Good one
This app is nice but the how you like audio and video he is coming some time so i disturb i can't able to attend my online classes
Priyanshu Yadav good when anyone is speaking I turn on my mic his/her sound come on my mic and the sound is repeated
Good app but add system default mode like it gets black with dark mode and and gets back white when dark mode is off
"The app is working great but there is a problem whenever I'm using it on my Mobile then I can't see the webcam of other members it just display a white screen. On the other hand, when I'm using on my PC then it works perfectly. I've tried on different mobiles but the issue was same. I hope you guys look into this and fix it soon!!"
Good.
Don't ask rate again and again
Not bad but sometimes the voice cracks
It eats too much of data. For 40 min. of meeting it takes approx 450 mn of data.
Google meet
It doesn't saport to above ðŸ’¯ persons but they ask that it is saport to 250 persons.
REMOVE the Google Meet from Gmail app. Its the worst option you did yet! I have a lot of problems by opening it through gmail. Worst Experience ever! If you have ALREADY created app (Google meet) Why did you shift it to GmailðŸ˜
Can improve more and more. Consuming our data a lot. Can make it less consuming or offline.
I don't like this app's updated version
If not work properly when join meeting
Good but more internet connection
You should give a personal chatting option in the meeting and split screen option
It have suffiecient update for this app we all have to support this app for officialy or online classes. I used for online classes and I have no network problem etc.
It is very useful for this situation it is useful for classes talking officialy it is helpful for us and maximum people use this app who are officialy and also for classes

This app is very nice but one problem it is aaking stars inbetween class so the class is closing it is very irritating
It should have an option to write name.

My problem message to everyone.i am send message on class privately but this option no in Google meet.
"GÃ¶rÃ¼ntÃ¼ kalitesi, ses kalitesi kÃ¶tÃ¼, ses ve gÃ¶rÃ¼ntÃ¼ gecikmesi var. (The picture quality, sound quality is poor, there is audio and video lag.)"
It's good
Why doesn't it have the recording option on the app? It makes life so difficult to always have to log in from a laptop for the recording option.
Feel like it lacks a lot of features.
It would be helpful if there is a recording option.
I can't add 250 participants in google meet but iin description google said we can
"It has been good app , some time it is struck"
"Good , but some times very slow viedo audio breaking up ,But some times good expirence"
I able to present screen but video sound is not audible in mobile give me solution in mobile
Network issues
There should be a feature for meeting link provider to control chats.
It is usefull app

What type of thing is this?? I have online classes just after half an hour. Please try to fix it as soon as possible. Thank you. It's a bit better now but it still laggs too much but better than before."
Add dark theme
The app window appears very small. It just utilizes only 25% of the screen and the rest is unused. Not sure why this is happening of late.
"Such a great app for classes and all . but ,I have a problem which is if someone call me between the classes and if I attend my call then , it end my class. such a worst thing in this app . This is the only reason of giving it three stars only .Google if you're reading it so please fix it . And the last version of Google meet was better than this .Thank you ."

"The app design is good making the meet more exiting, but the reason why I rated this app with 3 stars c'oz it always wanted me to rate it's audio and videa quality and then after I will be automatically removed from the meeting that i joined...tap the rejoin button and then repeat. In the end i was actually did not joined the meeting becauze of that."

"I used to love meet but new ui sucks ,old one was good"
"This is a good app for presentation and for other purpose but it have many drawbacks like blurr video, bad quality of voice. And a major problem that if any meeting is over then it not show that meeting is over and not response when meeting is over. Otherwise this is a good app. This help me in covid-19 period in my stydy. Thank you for keep my study ."

"Good ,but vedio clarity and audio clarity should improved!"
Latest updates is tooo worst screen is too small and I cant se comment section
"This update is very informal..... Please revert the version of google meet as it's very difficult to handle it. If I'm seeing the people by name, then it's very difficult to find one. And it took too much time if meeting gets full...."
I love the meet app earlier beacause it is better than zoom in many ways. But after the new update arrive.it is become not possible to rejoin the meeting and before the update it was very user friendly but after the update it become harder for a new user. Google please if you are reading this please release an update for user friendly interface. Thank you

IT IS GOOD BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE GUEST BECAUSE SOME UNWANTED PEOPLE INTERRUPT WHILE MEETING BUT THEY ARE NOT IDENTIFIABLE.
Bad voice
Good
In the new update the rejoin option is missing .previous was much better and easy accessable
"It was working fine recently, but ever since the update, the mic is not working when I'm wearing earphones. I thought the mic on my earphone was broken but when I tested it, its not. I have to plug out my earphones then unmute just to be able to use the mic. Very infuriating, I can't participate properly during online class!!"
Good
"Pata nahi yeh app mere mobile kyun kam nahi kar raha hai. Hamesa kahata hai ki ""unfortunetly reported."" But this app so very nice."
Only 100 people allowed now not supporting 250
"This application is good but not perfect I am student and our live classes are done by this application and sometimes I seems very blurred and hard to read any thing, I find very difficulties during the classes, I request to make this app more better than it is..."
This is a good application. But sometimes the audio or video will sometimes error wil come . This a good application for all of them it was helpful for me to see the online class.
Better
Not opening
It lack recording option I guess

Nice app for meeting But sometimes this app are very slow working ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
"It was working normally;but from one day it has been showing ""failed to join meeting "",whenever I click on meeting link to join.. Instead I m using gmail app for meets now."

"Google meet is a good for online meeting S, lectures so I like this app"
Good appðŸ‘Œmust use! for types of live meetings with people of all parts of the world.

It's very nice app. But your team should add private chat settings and whiteboard .
Please stop posting rating messages it interrupts important meetings
I can't see the presentation. The voice go echo. It is not very helpful to me. Now it is showing no such meeting. It made me absent.
"I don't know why sometimes while joining a meeting it displays - ""You can't join a meeting while on a call. "" I have no idea why it displays the message, though I am not on any call. Any answer from the Developer?"
"Well, the app is amazing but not perfect. I would like to give a couple of suggestions. First of all, you NEED to add private chat. And also add SPLIT SCREEN option. These two are too essential. So please"
Some time message typing not see
Sometimes I can't see or hear others response like all is mute but they can see my response Iam having online clases so I can't attend most of my classes due to this problem. But its a good app.
It's very good but . But it's taking too much of data; for 3 class it need 1.50 GB of data
Why did you add the option to turn of chat :( My teacher disabled chat and now i cant talk with my friends in classes :(
"In my Google meet, only 100 children are able to join it. Not 250 children, please explain why this is and give me solution. Pls"
The app is good but the new update is difficult to see in-call message and participants name it's really difficult to use the new version for me
This app is good but nowadays this app is not working sometimes it shows that meet has stopped and my my online class lefts. So plzz do something for that. Thank you

This is Worst updateðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
Good but difficult to use...to much network use this app
Good
"I love Google meet It is better than zoom in many ways but there is a downfall, the new update is not good. The old version had many easy and accessible features, the new update looks hard to co-op with. In the old version there was an option to rejoin the meet after leaving but this is not possible in the new update and we have to type in the meet code every single time!!! Google Please if u are reading this pls bring back the easiness of the old version with audible video presentation method."
This is nice app but sometimes it is bad
Ok but not satisfied
"Sorry to say that , this app have more problems to use like blur vedio , breaking of voice of both participant aand teacher also and other one is If suddenly due to internet issue I leave the meeting then after rejoin I can't able to see before's chat."
It is a good platform
"Poor video quality often,and whitescreen appears in video"
"Nice app â˜ºbut, it takes too much data... ðŸ˜ž"
Good app
Please bring some new settings to change the quality of the video
"The app crashes every time I try joining a meeting through a link. Whether that link is from Google Calendar or from the meeting list on Meet, this app keeps on crashing. Tried reinstalling it, didn't help. (Also using the app from the Work profile on Android 10, if that helps the app developer understand the issue better)"
Good
This is good but sometimes video comes blurry
It's a great app
This application must not give screen share option to all.
Please add an option for the host to end the meeting when he decides otherwise other participants can join the meeting after the meeting ends
Oky for local meeting not for special meeting
listen Google llc I am doing google meet from google chrome in my laptopWhenever I share a video it automatically it removes the sound but I can listen meeting participant can't listen they can only see please fix this problem

"I just updated my app to the recent update. Before the update I can easily press a link and I can go to the app and join the meeting. But after the update, the app just freezes the screen and I was not able to join my class. Even if I put the code in the join meeting it just keeps loading (p.s. i am not having any internet issue and my connection is pretty fast). Can you fix this?"
Tried as u said but in vain....
Best app for online classes. Very nice app
"Experience is not so good. Sometimes, there is voice and video lag of the third party in mobile version. Whereas, desktop version works fine. Please fix this issue, ASAP!"
"App is good deserves a better rating but the major problem on my android is when I am presenting screen with a video , the other members cannot hear the audio. Only the video is running. Please fix this and roll out the updates. It's difficult for people to present videos."
Good app but processing it poor
"This app is good .I like it very much . But ,we are in meeting , sometimes meeting will cut . So I hate this app.That the reason of I gave only three star ."
Vala vcfg
It's good app.but I 'am rating this app.even then it's send notification alarm for rating it in my ongoing meeting or class. If I am rating it or clock on not now option then I am automatically left from the meeting I have to click again and again on link for join meeting which causes disturbance ..........so please improve it.
"The app is good and easy to use but sometimes it works, and sometimes not. I used it in the second time, it didn't open and suddenly went home in my phone. It has also problem when i tried it to open in firefox app. I hope this would fix."
Need to improve captions
After use this app my phone hanged for 2-3 min...
Just some issue in video calls
Best app

It should support baground changer....like the baground is available in Google meet and we can change our baground it should be there
These app is having good security. But features are not having too much
Worst app it always strucks in between video and audio
Sanket
It was very good app But when the app very runing we can't pick the call
"Everything is so good about this app except for that if you share a video through your android device, it isn't audible. Please look into it"
It need too much MB that's only problem
Nice app

Recent update is worst
All my meetings are opening in gmail what is the use of this app?. I couldn't be able to open any link from gmail or calendar in google meet.
The main problem of this app Please add option Automatic join meeting is to this app to get free teacher to teaching
Students can't record meeting.. Yes But give the link to complain and we can't use Indian Mobile Number for voice ðŸ˜ ....Very Upset I AM..
It's very good but sometimes my voice is breaking and sometimes others who are talking to me
Not good enough

Ow!
Thia is a great application but after few time when I want to speak and I click on the screen to on the microphone then the screen freezes and i can't do anything We have to leave the meeting and again rejoin it.
Pls put a time limit for this app like 1 hours per meeting except that everything good

Good but there is network problem of vooice and pictures are not seen clearly so solve this problems.
"If we did not rate it, every 3-4 min the app ask us to rate between our class!! And also leave the class automatically if we did not rate it!!!!!"
"With the recent updates, the windows get freeze. All my parents are facing issue since 3vto 4 days. Seems like I will have to switch to zoom or any other platform... As suggested by you, tried clearing cache but no change in performance. We are using web browser for classes."
This app is ok the all students study

Can't say anything I don't know what all question this app asks good also and bad alsol
By mistake i chose Gmail to join a class meet from Google classroom and now I am not able to change it to Google Meet. I have to copy the link and then go to Google Meet. I want to change the default meet app from Gmail to Google Meet. I tried looking for such option in Google classroom but it is not there. I looked for it in mobile's settings and it is also not there. How do I change the default app?
By asking video and audio raiting respected it's block the communication other wise it is a best app
Good
Meet can be better platform of video meeting if recording feature is also enable for the students
It is very great paltform but it will needs some upgrades like admin setting on call after join the call show only single name and it will also but it has a problem like the video call education
Good
Voice was not clear
Again and again top on screen meet has not responding and fail to the join meeting .
"Yes it's better,but there is a problem that automatically left the meetings, anyone has this problem"
It was okay

Video quality is not much more.
"Hello Google, i generally schedule my meetings and take online lectures through my smartphone. Is there any way to auto admit participants while using google meet on a smartphone. Please tell"

"I am giving 2 stars because even on iPad I can only see people in sidebar view there is no option to change that, other than that it is a wonderful app."
How can we share document on screen for explanatiin
Whenever I try to send a message or an answer to the question. Someone left or join the meeting it shows above the send button. To send a single message I have to wait for 2 to 3 minutes. Please change the location for this notification.
"The new update totally sucks......They changed google meet like zoom.....First i can msg while i see the meeting but now i can't snd any messages and while i type it shows the someone joined and left where i can't see what i was typeing and in older version if i left a meet i shows an option like rejoin where it is easy to join but i new version if i left a meet unknowingly again from the first i have to paste it and give join etc,.......The older version is very good........"
We can see everyone on this
Not that good my voice stoped during the class and the network was full....
The app hangs in between the classes.
App is good but sometimes the audio quality is lagging...when 8-10 members join in this app then the lagging was started.I think jio meet is batter than this app.
Hi friends
Everything is great except these to which I found important.. 1. Plz provide a auto admit option for mobile app as it will he useful while conducting classes for students... 2. No one should present the screen without the permission of host as sometimes members other than host started projecting irrelevantly.
Increase the screen visibility ratio and display quantity please
"Meet is a totally useful app. Features are user-friendly. But, please do add the split-screen mode also."
I really like it . there is some bugs also.
I can't chat personally to my friend in meeting please solve it at soon.

"This app has one major prblm that is (I think I'm only having this prbm) ""FAILED TO JOIN A MEETING"" Edit:- I recovered it ... ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ"
Need improvement
It keeps signing me off in the middle of a meet when my wifi is good. The camera is ok although it keeps glitching the sound will be there but then the sound glitches.
Please add recording option for everyone..
I love the app because it doesn't use a lot of data. But the problem is that I can't open another app when it's running because it starts delaying the sound and it also uses a lot of battery ðŸ˜‘
My student everyday suffers from same problem. After she joins class within 30min automatically meeting get over. She could not reconnect. This happen only for evening lecture. And it shows failed to join.she even could not send the new link. Please help us in this matter.
When I record screen the voice doesn't record why? But still it is very nice app
"This app works well.But for the past few days this app doesn't work well with wired earphone.When I connect to a meeting with wired earphone (which works well with other apps),the mic doesn't working and it doesn't picking up any sound.Well if you first connect to a meeting with Bluetooth headphone and disconnect the Bluetooth headphone and connect with a wired headphone it works well.And also the app do well with phone's inbuilt mic.Please solve this bug in both gmail and google meet."

Add a nod extension for phone users!!!
Anurag Mishra
Vary nice app
The app is so good but some important features are missing in this application . For mobile version allow record meeting icon. There should be a personal chat icon in which we can chat personally to our group members that what to do or not. Create a built - in whiteboard.
I think this app have to be improve.
"The app has very good audio and video quality, but my issue is that for the past few days, when I try to join class, it just says "" Failed to join meeting"". I'm on stable wifi, and the app is up to date."
I think like zoom app it can also have a feature to send photo
When join meet I facing audio automatic disconnected nobody hear me pl.fix the problem
Had a good experience but should provide more limits of participation for free users.showing that only 100 participants can join a meet with a link at a time...
Good app for online meetings but sometimes there is an echo problem when 2 or 3 members on their mic fix this problem as soon as possilble
Good app
Can we use it in multi window

So I had a class n the teacher sent a group link .. everybody else from the class could join the meet but I couldnt ... Tried many ways to see if it works but nothing did please fix this issue asap
Aaa
Help for kids
Good but have many bugs if u remove them I will give u 5 stars
I didn't get new update in my mobile
"This is very good application. I have an opinion to add a option so that the host of the meeting could mute everyone (participants). Host now can remove or mute a person at a time , I wish host could mute everyone. Directly casting screen to Chromecast tv when in a meeting. (Like in Google photos or YouTube)"
Good
"Nowadays many colleges organised online classes in Google meet and many students are facing connectivity issues and thats why they're not able to hear the class properly, i request to google please add a Record options in meet then those students can download the recorded class, it would be great if you add this feature ðŸ˜€."
Please place the 'someone joined' 'someone left' section away from the typing space of a chatbox. It hampers the interaction.
It is a good app But I can't record the meeting When I start recording I can't use my mic and when I join or start the meet I can't record in mobile
Please add full screen view. And video quality is bad but net usage high!
Best
If i accidentally tap back button...i get left from meeting and then i need to join again..
It is beneficial for me to update Google meet or there are also some network problem I need à¤°à¤¿à¤ªà¥à¤²à¤¾à¤ˆ for my question

Good and à´ªàµŠà´³à´¿

Why can't I view the screen presented in full screen anymore? It would've been better if I could see full screen to take screenshots. And there's a shadow at the bottom of the screen.
"Can google meet access slow net speed by giving better video quality???because I'm not allowed using wifi by my parents during online classes in new-normal situation,so I have to depend on mobile data which is weaker than wifi......So my request to GOOGLE LLC to access slow net speed for better video......though video quality supports high internet speed...ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º...hope you shall keep my earnest request......"
Good
Very simple and easy....

Nice app but screen share problem
It ia really good app
Much consumption of data while showing any video or presentation.
Brilliant app but it's server is very slow and only 100 people can join.
This app is very nice but the voice is not good
"It requires high internet speed.. even if my data goes off for a second, it exits the meeting. MS Teams or zoom try to reconnect, which is way better. And plz make it split screen compatible for samsung.."
It does not have Private chat during the meeting. Google Please fix this .

This is a good app but in the middle of the meeting they ask for rating I get left from the meeting. Please stop doing that.
Very nice viedo
In between the meeting it always asks for the rating rather than that it's awsome
"Great app! Will give 5 stars if you add the feature to save meeting codes before the meeting, within the app."
Not bad
It is good but from some time I am facing a problem that when I use the meet in my tablets or mobile there is white screen which appears time by time doesn't happen in laptop.

Please update rotate screen feature
"It is a really nice app , it has nice video and audio quality . But there is more joining problems . This is 100% a bug . So please fix it Google . Thank you"
It is nice but while updating the application if we are using meet it closes automatically. This is wrong. It is showing too late if someone joins or left. Sir I always update it to new version then also this happens
I m giving only 3 star because there is no dark mode.....!
This app is very useful
It is really a nice app but it's video quality is bad....

"It's pretty sad because all Google apps including chrome have dark theme. Due to online class my child has eye itching,redness,and other irritation because of the white colour of the screen. My child and her friends all have this irritation, and also they have send feedback more over 5 times. There is no dark theme in only Google meet,and other meeting apps including zoom, have included dark theme. And my child has class at early 6 30 morning too! So please enable dark theme at next updateðŸ™"

Overall is ok.Pls make this app support for dual screen mode...it's very difficult to use without dual screen mode....Google meet in gmail its support...but this app doesn't
Ok
This app need to improve it more like inserting background.
Guyf
My Sound is not heard by other members when I present my screen.. why does this happen
Nice application for online classes
Please help me out..as the moment i switch on my video i got disconnected or else my video won't be switched on like it shows my profile only though my video is on...
Nice. But It will be better if rotation lock option is added to the mobile version. And I am quite unhappy with this app because it is not given whiteboard feature in normal version.
Keep on asking ratings.. It's really disturbing while I'm in google meet.. And it's made us left the meet..
It doesn't work when I have my hotspot on and disconnected from the internet as I try to join a class
I am unable to add participant more than 100. Even though it shows 250 limit.
Overall it is okay And add mute option for student to mute other students
This app uses more data(internet) Compared to the apps Serving Same purpose so i suggest to u that u can Reduce the date usage of the app plz do that...
Ok
Ok
Not best
Useful for students and company meeting
In meeting receiving a call it leads to close the meeting this is major problem
Nice
Exactly
Gud
Not bad
Good to communicate
Update shows that it supports 250 members. But the maximum is 100. Very badðŸ‘Ž
"In the presentation the volume of the video is very low and also sometimes video may blurred and voice struck but it is good for students so, please solve the problem as soon as possible. Thank you!"
This is a good app. I have been using it since the month of July. But few days ago when I updated the app problem started arising. The moment I minimise my screen and move on to another app like WhatsApp or chrome the meeting ends. This wasnt happening until I updated the app. This problem has spoilt my views regarding the app. Another thing is that I would like it if the app provides an option of personal chatting.
Not good at all
"Obviously good application by Google LLC and the facilities are nevertheless good but there some problems for which I gave it 3 stars. The first is the app crash which take place all of a sudden one day. The next is the problem with the captions or rather the subtitles as when I turn on them, for 35 or more seconds they didn't work actually. The next is that the video quality is very poor, and is not up to the mark. I request Google LLC to handle over and try to solve this problems ."
Good
this app is help to vedio confrring but its vedio was bluring awary time please improve it because i give 3 star
It is good but sometime i can't join meeting it says failed to join meeting and also sometime people can't listen my voice
I can't record meet ...there is no option
I like this app but it sometimes crashes when the meeting is too long and the video of mine as well as other people in the meeting either freezes or blurs mostly . I've a good network connection but still these things happen . Please fix these problems else everything is good . With some minor bugs . And so I've rated it 3 stars .
"Please give dark mode of this app in your second update so, we can also save battery."
"Es buena pero necesita mejoras, sugiero una opciÃ³n para borrar nuestros mensajes del chat eso la harÃ­a mil veces mejor"
Very nice app easy to handle
Ok ðŸ‘Œ
In this app good but low network connection Will call disconnect. This problem for big issue
Video quality ðŸ˜¢
"Im unable to download this app, could someone tell me what's the problem?"
Please devlop the connection properly it was lagging too and audio was not very clear
Nice
It not good ..improve video qualiy
It is a good app.. But plz help me.. It takes almost a minute to join any meeting even though Net connection is fast
Very good app
Ok
Plz solve the high net issue
"I get to join 1 meeting link every day. The first time, we have to press ask to join...fine. But, the second time I join, why do I have to press ask to join then. (Every day, I join with the same e-mail ID and name.) This is the reason why I gave 3 stars instead of 5 stars. This app is very good by the way but the problem I wrote, PLEASE FIX IT."
There is no personal chatting In meeting so I will rate 3 star plz add this
"It would be really helpful if there was a signal strength bar or something like that which showed the signal strength in the app itself. Most of the time, the teacher or lecturer doesn't know when the video or audio breaks."
"This is a very good app for schools... I recommend this.. but a problem that the previous meetings doesn't show up.... So I need to again and again type it and one more is that when I try to join a meeting, it sometimes shows that invalid URL or takes 5 - 10 minutes even after reinstalling, it comes the same... Otherwise, everything is going well.... I hope you can find a solution to it....."
"It is not working from Past few days. It shows white screen of the meeting host. I have done clear data and also reinstalled the app, then also the screen of the host comes white. Andi also have a strong network connection. So please help me out"
voice and video.quality is poor that's why im rating 3 star
"Good video calling app. But, app need to improve. I want picture in picture mode. App use huge data."
The app is a kinda OK.... The voice keeps breaking ....
Good app
Good
Good
When I joins the meeting this app stops working
Good app
Super google meet
I like this app
It's a very good video conferencing app and i will give it 5 star but due to auto screen change i will giving it 3 star i hope that it will be repaired soonly
It is a nice app but a problem that whenever a participant joins or leaves so it interrupts in the messaging box and we are unable to type and send the message
"Please give the option of direct landscape mode, so that we have not to turn on the auto rotate settings of our phone."
Please make prsnol chatting
"Problem here is I can't enter the meet to my class It keeps on saying""Couldn't find the meeting you're trying to join.You might not be signed in with the right account"" for last week til today on my laptop I Updated it already but It still says the same, I tried joining the meeting on my Phone but It always says ""Failed To Join Meeting"" And Its actually Annoying so Please Fix This."
Need to be updated . Plz
"I don't know why ,today morning it is showing that unfortunately meet has stopped and when I tried it in another phone it is showing that failed to join, at all the time. Then I updated it and restart the phone but no use.. Plz tell me a solution."
"Ok I update the app, now the app is working so superb, thank you for reply me and thanks a lot Google meet."
"It was a good app earlier, but now when i join the meeting my data gets automatically off. I don't knw what's going on. It is not working properly â˜¹ï¸."
It is nice app for meeting.
This is wonder ful app
I think that if Google meet support split screen it is easier to use two apps at the same time and the video presentation was always blurred I could not get that what was it presenting
Not bad
It's a very good app to conduct a meeting but sometimes the meetings are suddenly cut off that is why I am giving this app 3 stars rating.
ðŸ‘
Good
Its voice is breaking
Meanwhile we were doing classes in Zoom but because it crashes a lot so we trusted this app and continued here..But again the same thing happened here also the video quality is so bad everything is blurred and the voice was cracking even everyone can't here the host voice..Please fix it
It's good but when will the manual rotate feature available on meet just like YouTube it's very annoying turning on auto rotate then it automatically rotates the screen even if I don't want to with slight orientation
"I can't add more than 100 people in meeting with a normal gmail ID,what should I do to add more people?"
It is good

Please add split screen.
Sound is not clear... Maximum time mitting is not joined..

The newest update is good but accessing the chatbox has become a bit more complicated. It would have been better if the chatbox was easily accessible. Hope the problem would be resolved in future updates
This app is good for online teaching.

In this app sometimes voice does not go
This app is best for vedio conference but personal chat not available
"I was not able to record the meeting ........ and there is no reactions like to raise your hand , smile face etc ..."
"This is amazing app and I love meetings in this.. But the reason I have 3 stars is ""WHEN I CALL AND IF I OPEN MEET AFTER 1 HOUR IT SAYS THAT """"YOU CANT JOIN VIDEO CALL WHILE YOU ARE ON A PHONE CALL"" please do something Google this is a request..."
Why we can't adjust video and audio quality like pc version ?
Overall good...its a request to remove the pop up notification of joining at the chat bar...... because we cannot type at the moment ....
"Good app but wn i used it for frst time , my interÃ±et connrction aÃºtomattically goes on aÃ±d off but from next day it is good .."

The option of recording a meeting should also be available on android devices as it can be easy for students to record the meeting video call and go through it later. Please make this option available on android devices so that the students can also use it.
Good
The moment I entered my link my network is not working how can I fix it .
"This should have private chat and everyone can record it,more than 4-5 people cannot open their mic at a time"
Very nice chatting app
Thanks for the reply
Not bat . We cannot on many student's video at same timeðŸ˜”ðŸ¤¨
Very nice app but I can't change my name devoloper give me idea how to change my name
When call come it is leaving the meeting
"It is a good video conferencing app.However, after the latest update the graphics have got very bad.For example, when I attend video calls after the update and someone is presenting,thes screen is too small and all the other features have been also not that good.Before the update it was good. So please bring back the earlier graphics. Also, please add a few new features in the chat like private chatting,saving messages,deleting message (after posting them),etc."
This app is good but it should have a better picture quality of screen share and many time voice break with good connectivity
"Best but some time not work well in online meeting but this is better platform for online meeting, classes"
"Overall good Experience! But 2 big issues, here anyone can mute anyone... And while presenting, if any other meet member start presenting in between, the presentation is overlayed, and the sound distrots! Hope this will be solved in the next update ðŸ˜ƒ"
"After updating the app. I am facing problem in creating a new link.. it says u are not able to do video call , as u are in phone call. ... But instead of not having on a phone call.... What shall I supposed to do"
It's was good before..but now whenever I open and join a meeting it just show white screen..... everytime..... please fix my problem
I'm a student and this app is good and i don't face any difficulty but when i downloaded this app to another phone the settings are totally changed and I don't know from where i can fix. First there are three segments but now wrote any cmnt frst separately open the cmnt section which is so irritating and time consuming and then post. The frst version is so satisfying and convenient. Fix this problem so that i can took my classes easily. Thnkw
"Every thing is great but, the only thing which pinned me is that l could not edit my name (write my own name as this is my mom's mobile) it creates an issue as l use this app for my school purpose, otherwise great app where you can also zoom the screen to see the things that are visible small."
"Almost everything is good,but app is using G- sensor while in meeting which creates problem sometimes"
Best
Need more development because the host should have more button on the screen .
It's good but but sometimes the voice is not clear and and the video also
GOOD
Please add full screen for android phone otherwise I really like the application

Please add some filter it seems much betterðŸ™ðŸ»
I am user of this app since past 4 months I was able to join the meeting with the link and the link would direct me to Google meet but now after the latest update it directs me to Gmail by default . Please tell me how can I change this setting.......
App is good. But the only problem is that the other participants are unable to hear my voice though my audio is unmuted. I have reported the problem thrice and there's still no response.
Please Fix the recorder of Mic doesnt work!!. I found a solution if you have earphone and the voice doesnt work. You need to connect your phone to a bluetooth speaker. Wait for it to connect and your device will appeared connected.Tap on the earphone icon and choose the bluetooth device and after that off the bluetooth device. And the google meet will automatically connect to your earphone and the voice on earphone will now work. But please google fix the bug!! Its 100% a bug!
Please fix these problems: 1)Add raise hand and other option. 2)Chat should be shown anyone who rejoin meeting or join late . 3)Caption should also be in other languages.
Photo quality is good................but sound quality is not so higfigh
Meets app is very helpful for meeting
I wanna thank Google meet bcoz only due to it we students were able to continue our studies in this pandemic so efficiently unless some improvement is needed but good .
Hey Google Sometimes I can't join the meeting It shows Failed to join meeting
Captions are not so effective and efficient....
It kinda sucks on my experience in online class but in my last orientation it was great but now the new update is just horrible earlier today I had online class and then my gmeet started to hung / hang when I was about to answer my teacher's question Please fix this situation Also my connection was fine it was really Like there was nothing wrong with my connection
Not a good quality of video
Everytime we have a meeting the rating for audio and vedio will always pop up
Very few functions
This is a best
I dont think we can accommodate 250 participants in this . If we can then please tell me how ?
it was good at half bt suddenly it on's vedio and audio during lecture without permission its very embarrassing ðŸ˜ bt over all its fine
I think there is some glitch in this app.... May of time i enter a meeting... But many of time it happens tht i am not audible to other and no one can see my video on.....due to this my teacher has marked my absent many times
Nice and this is a wonderful app
The sound mostly interrupts
i love the app
This app is pretty good. But the main problem with this app is IT DOESN'T RECORD SOUND IN SCREEN RECORDING. And we are not able to record the class lectures. Please fix the problem.
I cant able to use phone screen recording its muting audio automatically

I would totally rate it 5â­ if only it would support split screen and also the app is really lagging when you have poor internet connectivity that affects the other members inside the meeting.
Why our camera be off while switching to other app it should not be and we be leavenby clicking on back button on mobile so plz improve it
1 misstake that is if we go out video will and we can't record audio during meeting Please change these 2 things my request
This app is very good but there are only some problems with this app When ever I try to join a scheduled meeting and I click on the link it says failed to join meeting which is a lot irritating and I do not have option to msg anyone in meeting privatly.. Please fix This ASAP ðŸ˜ðŸ˜

"Firstly, I have visited your help or customer care website. I was attending classes from my laptop and tab both, on G Meet. I attended the first 2 months of my classes only with my laptop, then my google meet microphone went off, totally off!!! I then started attending from my tab and laptop both, one for audio and one for video but then after 1 month my Tablet Google Meet Microphone Also Went Totally Off!!!! Now I am attending from my phone which has almost no features. Not 5 Stars!"
Good
1. Pllz add auto add in the class. Many times we face disturnance while attending class. 2. Add rotation option for proper view of slide. 3. Attedance system should be added. ðŸ™‚
In between of the class it always demand for rating But still better than zoom
"I am facing a major problem while using the chat, whenever someone leaves or joins the meeting it's notification blocks the send button completely and i am unable to send message in the chat until that notification disappears. The main problem lies in the end of the meeting when i need to send a message and people start leaving or rejoining i miss the perfect chance to send my message."
"Hey Google, if you remember then I have reviewed something here. You said to give a feedback from the app. I did. But still it is not fixed. My problem was that when I minimize the Meet, I cannot hear anything and then after some seconds if I am not back, then I am out from the meeting. This is a serious issue becuase we have some documents that we need to see from outside. So please fix this issue. I use Android 5.1.."
It is nice app.it is best app
Pressing the Back Button exits the meeting without any confirmation. Accidental touches are very common so it should atleast get confirmation from the user to leave the meeting.
This app show youtube channel name so this thing is very because I am attending online classes so i give it only 3 âœ´âœ´âœ´star
It consumes much more internet than any other app. Can anyone tell me why??
Nice
Good
Ik
Super app

"I'm the host for meetings but I keep having issues with the meeting ending abruptly. I get the dialog box asking how the meeting quality was. It's very disruptive to the classes I'm teaching. I have to join back in, reconnect my Bluetooth & figure out where I left off. I've looked thru all the community posts & do not see an answer. I've restarted my phone. I have a stable & fast internet connection. This only started in the last week."
The main problem is Google meet don't provide private chat option like in meeting if you have to say something to a particular person you can't do
Nice quality
How can we join the meeting without permission from host
Meet is a very helpful for students i started using this app since july month but sometime in between the voice breakes and i got disconnected again and again

I do have question is it the same at the right side on Gmail app? If it's the same then we don't need to install it.. response..
It's good but not better. I liked zoom app more than this.
"It is a really nice video conferencing app. Everything is good. But from the past few days, the video quality has dropped significantly. I cannot make out anything in the incoming video. It had also happened earlier, but it was not happening for sometime. Now it had started again. It looks like a bug because both of us (sender and receiver) have good internet connection, but still it persists. In contrast when the sender is presenting, everything is good even the video presented through camera."
Good app
I am a student and I would really like for this app to be used in split screen mode so I can take exams while meeting with my classmates and teacher
Vishal
sir google meet aap ko jab start karne par 4g gayab ho jata he and other aaps chalte he leakin jo problam he google meet aaps pe he to kya kare ham sir pliss
App crashes while I am using it in landscape mode. It crashed thrice in a 30 min meeting. I am using a good phone with sufficient ram and storage available. Please fix this issue. Also ensure that we are able to see the full screen in portrait mode. Currently in portrait we can see in half the screen what the camera captures. I am using the updated version of meet. And also cleared the cache and restarted the phone but still the same issue.
Please bring old version ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜Œ
"Everytime I go to Playstore to download this app, it says 'Not compatible with your device version'. What am I supposed to do? How do I download it then?"
Fair
It's so simple and easy to use. But it has a lot of problems at the audio and the images. The audio sometimes can't be used. The images from the person I want to look at not appear although that person already activated it.
This is a leaning app for kids and i thanks for made this app
Beneficial for meetings and online classes but the only demerit is that not more than 100 can join
It's good
Good app works. But sometimes shows failed to join.
Good
Something went wrong why?

It's good app but now my photo to teacher can't see

This app is very helpful to me because in lockdown our teachers are taking online classes on meet. Also it is working very properly.

There's no way to make video full screen. It's very difficult to read a presentation when you have small screen and that's also not utilised fully
"The app is very useful indeed, but there are many problems. I can't use my microphone on other apps whenever I start Google meet Please solve this problem"
Download it google meet all
"I have just installed it, but can't program a future meeting, why"
But 100 people are joined not more.... but this app is good for any meeting
Aachchhe se kam nhi karta h
For 2 weeks there is no option for creating new meeting and enter code . Please google help me out with this.
"While logging showing faild to join meeting, please suggest solution"
Its good but there is no filters. I need filter like snapchat pls make us feel good
"1) The screen share option is pretty ""underdeveloped"" It'll be a lot better if you allow to share a video playing along with it's audio... 2) there is no option to change both the ""input and output video resolution"" in the app while it is there in pc... It'll be a lot better as it'll take less internet ... 3) Pls allow to see the videos of 4 users at a time (helpful especially to teachers )along with the participant list and their videos like Zoom, 4) Enabling whiteboard option in the app"
It not support for 250 person it supports only 100
Better now
It will be great if the new update enable the user to share screen and sound at the same time on mobile phone

I couldn't hear voice and the voice is breaking. The presentation is very slow. I am requesting you to solve it fast
It needs lot of improvements and updates sometimes seems weird that a tech giant is unable to replace zoom and give a fantastic app. Hopw to get it soon.
Good but not so good it needs improvement it should have features to mark on a presentation to show our teachers
This app is only for video call not for online classes because it does not provide more things that exist in zoom . And it can be improve so please improve as zoom. THANKU.

"I love this app but somehow still hate it. It's cheaper to use when you compare to zoom especially if you use cellular data. If you guys added a screen share where you can share docs to the others in the meeting it would be great and better just like in zoom. Google, I know that you can crush the be competition. Anyways due to that I'm giving 3 stars"
Super app

Whenever I join a meet the chat box should contain all chats from start of meeting remaining ever thing is ok
"This app is worthy of getting 5 star, because we can record with the permission of host and also we can rejoin if the host mistakenly remove us and also this app is for unlimited time meeting not like zoom which demands money for more than 40 minutes.... But...,personal chat is not the here that make difficult to convey personal messages and also disconnecting audio option is also not here we need not need to hear what we don't like..please upgrade these facilities then it will be awesome."

Voice is breaking
This is very good app ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
"The app really is just too basic with virtually features. We need to be able to turn off incoming video if need to, control volume better, control streaming quality, and has to be easier to use with a better UI. Is this too much to ask, Google? Imrpove Meet without breaking it. What we have right now is just average. It's not broken or anything, but can be a lot better."

"Respected team meet, The recording feature of g suite is only available for the laptop version of 'meet' and not it's mobile version. Pls add the recording feature for the mobile application too. Since everyone can't have a pc or a desktop to access this feature. And since mostly this app is used by students of schools who barely have an android phone can't record a class they didn't understand and watch it over and over again for the revision of topic. -A student"
I'm not able to multitask Not even open another window.

In between the class rate now is coming and the class is going

"Dear google team please try to solve this problem ðŸ™ ""If we click our back option then the meeting is ending And also we can't talk with any one during meeting"
"Everything is okay but when I opened the link ,it is going to gmail although this app is already installed in my mobile, so please give me a solution for this problem."
Good
Better
This is over all good. But Scheduling meeting is not possible.. right?? Also recording not possible..right? Also sometimes evenif there is no call going and if we try to start a meeting.. message will come as ' cannot start meeting while there is a call going on'.. For one of my student when he is attending a class in meet after another one.. he is getting the message ' no such meeting'. Sometimes audio quality is very bad
its good app but only zoom options for android phone.so need development of zooming option for laptop also...
Plz add some face filters like not fun filters just filters which make the skin clear and nice give your skin a color It is very needed google meet
Google meet is best
It's good
Fudu app
This is a good app. but some times this app consumes more data.
There must be an option to send message to any person persomally in a meeting of many peolpe
"The app is working just fine. Although it would be great if data consumption could get reduced somehow and also if this app has a driving mode in it , I would definitely give 5 ðŸŒŸ"
Nice
The voice was breaking ðŸ™„ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜– A lot.
Desent

veri nice app
"I have been using google meet since two years and everyday it is getting better , but recently i have come across with a problem with it .I have also updated my app to the most recent version also i tried rebooting my device but it didn't work. The problem is that in my mobile i have almost 4 google accounts and among 2 of them in meet i get to see only the meeting code option that too if i paste any valid meeting code it shows no such meeting.Waiting a response from them.Still the app is superb"
Nice app
"One suggestion that whenever a person lefts the meeting his/her name is shown that he/she has left the meeting which covers the typing area and unable to access, hence when multiple people's leave one by one ,I am unable to access the chat area as it is blocked by the pop-up message that someone has left, fix it I mean put that somewhere other place on the screen.plzzz"
Nice app
"It was very useful for me and other students because it was very easy to join and use the video is very clear, smooth, and stable but the voice is breaking out sometimes but not so bad the voice is quite decent for users."
I was soo excited about the updation of 31 August as my friends said it's super cool. I was late to update that I updated this today. But nothing happened. Is that the problem with my phone or something or will it work. My friends are sending screenshots of the updation and Iam disappointed ðŸ˜Ÿ
We need many improvements.. first while pressing the back button from a meeting it should are u sure to exit or display press back again to exit because we accidentally press back button many times and exits the meeting without our knowledge. The second one we need private messaging public chatbox is available but we need private chat. And the last one is while opening our video it should show a preview and ask whether we are sure. So make these improvements
"I was using it for past 3 months it was very well amd good. But suddenly today it automatically crashed.. It left the meeting automatically and i was unable to join the meeting thereafter., all where present but it kept on showing themeeting doent exist!!.. Idunno whats the problem... But i definitely lost my attendance... Please ensure in furture updates there wont be any sudden crash"
i love this app but the audio is breaking
It is good for online classes but sometimes it doesn't present screen and it eco our voice so for that I have given 3Stars
"I am student and this app is perfectly fine,but it lacks many features like sending private messages to mam or other participants... And at times when I pin my teacher the screen turns blank.. and there are many bugs in the app.. so kindly rectify these error.. even tried contacting the developer through Gmail but no use.."
This app is so good but some. Problems are create is 1. It consuming more internet as compared to other apps and 2. Its captions not clearly taught us thanks
"Add more features like saving messages, video"
ðŸ‘
Sound bad
Very good
"I would have given 5stars if there was a option of private chats because when we are in meeting in any group discussion we can't text privately to the person or team and discuss, please do add this private chat option or else everyone might use other apps other than that enjoying the app"
Could you please develop this app (google meet) for the kitkat version
This app is very useful to me. I have only one problem in this app that's is I will join the meeting that's through out automatically this is the problem
We need dark theme for these app because while listening to class we are getting eye strain due to white light....plz give it in next update... thank you google....
Why is it keeps on asking for rating it frequently while online class? Not now can't be used or else it makes leave the meeting - this is totally waste for asking it to rate it

"There is an issue with joining a meeting in google meet using Link. Those who get this link can join, so make an option that only assigned persons can join. I am saying this because I had an issue with that. Anonymous person joined my meeting. Someone with a weird name."

"I have the app installed on my phone but when I want to join a meeting , it joins with G - Mail."
"It is a good app . Clarity all are ok but , using with WiFi is not enough good overall it is a good app.."
"We are leaving the meeting directly when we unknowing touch the back button.. Kindly add the exit or not feature when we touch back button, so that we dnt leave the meeting unknowingly"
We have to go to options every time to switch the camera! Which is very annoying it would have been a lot helpful if the switch camera is also there on the screen!!
It is good but not yet.I dont like is quality of video and voice....
I want to give 5 star to this app but I am giving 3 star because of this type of app we have to study in lock down also.ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”°

"It consumes a lot of data. 1 hour of meeting in this app takes about 1gb of data where as other online meeting apps in its comparison (zoom ,Microsoft teams .etc.) takes about 100mb of data in 1 hour. Other than this , everything is really impressive with the app."
Hi I'm an admin of G- Suite for education. Since few days many of my students and staff facing a problem related to Google meet. when they are trying to join meeting through Google classroom its redirected them to the gmail meet instead of Google meet. Kindly reply me with the solution.

I cannot turn my account to G-suite account. Very bad app
Please add white board on Google meet
Ok but need to improve .
While using this app I am unable to listen our teacher and any fellow mate. Kindly help me what should I do so that the teachera and fellow mates ahould be audible to me
I like but something like equater line it's is not fixed because network problem is there but if there is full network then to it is not clear. And by the way the rating comes between the clas s and then class end. Please update this app more
Pls give me dark mode
"Very bad interface, when I get a phone call meet disconnects automatically and exits out of the meeting. It's the first time we are seeing a feature like this,which is really annoying as the in and out of the times are recorded ,students have to face problems with attendance. Fix the issue asap,btw new UI looks bad."
Why doesn' t my google meet link open these days and shows failed to join meeting?
"It would have been better if we could send private message to a person, but currently if i want to chat with someone , then i will have to say it publicly, it's annoying and embarrassing. Please solve this problem"
If this app supports split screen it would be great. And it sucks all my data in half an hour while on everyone in the meeting turns on their video
"The video of the members comes only in the small screen(where they're profile appears) , the main screen appears White even if i have pinned the person and when the internet is quite good .This problem has been continuing for a lot of days."
The new version of meet is not coming for me......but the app is sooo gud for online classes... but some issue like the new version is not coming...
Please put grid view options in this app .. because when we use this i can only view few people
Integrating with email and calendar was a good move. But the earlier interface and the layout for the meeting was better in the mobile version.
I am unable to join When I am clicking the link it shows failed to join the meeting Plz resolve it fast I uninstalled app for 2 times and re install then also it's not joining
Here is a problem in going into the meet in that time the round is buffering repair this problem.
"This is great , but while attending classes this aap drains too much battery life , Please do something about it."
Good
Need to Video clear increas update and voice clear.bro ...and need to dark theme lanch Best Rotation and screen record with voice for only study...by a student .
Good
"Nice app. Good audio and video is ok but why can't it just minimise like the other apps? I tap on the back button and I am removed from the meeting. Also, may you guys include the feature for end meeting? The host either has to remove the members himself or tell them to leave. It is also chaotic at times when many people want to answer. I suggest including by any means raising hand. May you also make the closed captions have the option to change language per session. Like in Swahili sessions"
Please remove the feature which do not allows to re enter the meeting after being removed. It creates a difficulty for a student accidentally removed. Please remove this feature.
Love to use this app.....
Please bring a new version of Google meet of join without admiting
Google meet not have slipped screen please add this feature very important feature please give
First the app was working very good but suddenly today my mic did not work I was unable to say anything what should I do now please tell me

"Hi.........i am Absana..This is a good App... But there we are facing one problem. I am a student and I used to do class through online in Google meet. But the problem is, There are many students like 158 or 176 but here only 101 students can join.... So other students are facing problem... So please ðŸ™ correct this issue...

Please include full screen mode when sharing mobile screen.
Can't present screen. Can someone please help me on this? Any help would be very much appreciated â˜ºï¸
It's a good app....video quality is also good...but the only reason for 3 stars is... It's a very much data consuming app....in only one class it takes my 50 Percent of data.. And I can't do what I want....please do something and make this app a less data consuming app....ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
Not able to update
Good app but I have one problem I have given so many times ratings after class but it still shows to give ratings but why after every meeting it shows this and this is what I feel very disgusting and the video and voice quality is also not good sometimes it not join also and one more thing I think that I should upgrade the app then it will work smoothly but it doesn't change anything so please check it out.
Good but some problems like..Screen sharing is unstable....please improve.

This app was great but please add an option for private messaging so it will be comfortable. I'm giving three star for this
App is Great...But introduce naming feature...which is not related to Google
"Almost few to nil settings available in the app, back button closes the meeting instead of minimising, no option for private chat, unable to type in chat when people are joining or leaving. Significantly lacks features when compared to its alternatives. Needs improvements."
Why I am leaving the group after 2 min
"Hello developers, I'm happy to use this app it is better than any other I've used, but only one problem it's exiting without any pop-up message like ""Are you sure want to leave the meeting"" it is causing more problem to me, if i accidentally clicked the back button on my mobile it existing the meeting without the pop-up it's frustrating me. So please kindly add this pop-up thing it will be more help full for me and some others like me."
Why cant i download this on my tablet we brought it for online class but i cant download it in there it says your device is not compatible with this version? Pls tell me what i should do i need to do online class

"Very poor app ,when l attend my class it ask me how is the audio and video and after the feedback that I give to it then it start to control my work it just back and again and again leave the meating ,it is very irritating"
Good
Nice app
Hey Google meet plz make a feature of dark mode in the background in Google meet app
It is a very good apps but I think it should have more features like 1. It should have feature of whiteboard. 2. Anyone in meeting can able to send messages privately to particularly to a person in a meeting. 3. You should change the interface of the app same as of meet in GMAIL. I think these first two updates is compulsory nad third is not much compulsory for app although it is a nice app for school classes
Good app
Its good but noy as muvh as zoom
Good but an update is required
"The application is very high use mobile data and videos not clear, voice breaking etc......"
Good app
"This app is really good, but it has some problems which had to be sorted out:1- when joining the class by tapping link in google classroom, it opens with gmail, which is not likely to be, as then this app would have no use.2-when whatsapp call comes, the sound of others in the meeting starts coming from the earpiece instead of earphones while using bluetooth devices, it should perform like mono audio system. 3-Normal call is not supported to act while meeting is going in meet. Kindly fix bugs."
my Mike does not open and it is a big problem . i do not able to answer . it also consume more network than other apps
Why split screen is not available for this app
My mic dosen't work.
OK
It's very important
"Hi there! I want you to know that this our common app for online classes. I want to suggest to please add that Nod, hands up reactions and if possible, push to talk feature for android users like the one used on desktop. This would make us, student phone users, to have a convenient online classes."
It is good but I suggest this to have a grid view like what can be seen on a laptop or a desktop.
Good
"Acrescentem um jeito da pessoa apresentar e ver o chat ao mesmo tempo!!! E quando estou pelo smartphone e alguÃ©m sai, o aviso se quem saiu ou entrou fica em cima do chat e eu nÃ£o consigo selecionar para digitar."
"I like this app so much and i can listen my online classes easily throw this app. But i have a problem that i am using mobile to listen class through this app so if when anyone left the meeting, i can't chat because it will come the name who left at the chat box. And it is showing for long time , if any one left of join the meetings."
More features is needed Presently it's very simple
Nice experience
Don't show any notification plz
"I wish when your chatting and somebody leaves it doesnt block the chat box, because right when the teacher was about to end I wanted to leace a last minute message but I was blocked from sending the message due to pop ups of ""person has left the meeting"""
Is aap ki kabhi vedio saff nahi aati aur kabi audio
App works great however it doesn't show the pictures of other users.
"The app is good but in android phone when i click the exit button i left the meeting at once.You should make a function of warning like ""do you want to left"" like that. please give a feature of record a meeting in android phones.."
This app is so recommend for online class because of the pandemic.But some issues or bugs.#1 laggy sometimes #2 Bugs if I'm gonna mute my self does didn't work #3 glitches if I'm gonna on my camera it's show error But good job dev!

Sirf aadhi e screen pe dikhta h
It is good for study
Its strucking please give update version
"Well definitely it is a good app. Only flaw is when some one playes Video or shares there screen, in viewer screen it lags a lot even with a good connection. Not an app for teaching yet. Hopefully they release an update which fixes this bug of lagging during Playing video."
THIS APP ALWAYS LACK
"The reason why am I giving this app 3 stars is that the chatting system of this app is very poor. Other video conferencing apps like Zoom, Microsoft Team etc have private chatting facility but this amazing app doesn't have this facility. So ""Google"" pls work on this. Then this will be a awesome app. Work work work on this issue...."
The app is closing immediately after giving rating in the middle of class. Solve this problem as soon as possible.
It's a very nice app but not good facilities as zoom or WebEx meeting
Consumes lot of data
"It was all ok but recently I'm facing some opening issues. Whenever I'm getting the link to join the meeting, although I have the app installed in my phone, once clicking on the given link it's again and again opening through my gmail. I'm not able to join through the app. I have the updated version of Google meet installed in my phone and also have tried by clearing the cached data. But it's again the same. Please give me a solution to this."
This is a very nice app for virtual meetings but audio problem needs to be resolved while screen sharing. It is major drawback of this app.
"I had a problem in chat , I beg you to make a option to delete a chat which we send And make a option to chat with some one personally"
It is good but sometimes the sound was breaking and video was not clear

Very useful app I use it for my online classes This works very well without any problem

I wish to have filters on mobile phones too thats all
Thuuu......
"Voice and Video Quality is good. The only suggestions are: 1) Remove ""Present Now"" Button from Home Screen of Mobile Application as well as from Website desktop version. Because, many people mistakenly press ""Present now Button"". 2) Once the screen shared using ""present now"" button it should be seen in maximized mode default to everyone. 3) present now feature should be in control of host of the meeting. He should lock the present now feature during meeting and assign to a specific person."

This app is very useful in pandemic situations. This app have a good quality. Meetings also go smoothly. The ' Google Meet' is the best app.ðŸ‘
Hi Google team. You have developed a very nice app but the problem has arrived with your new latest update. The new version is good as it has a larger screen but the only problem is the chatbox. The message box is too inside. During online classes we need to send some quick messages. But now in the the new update you have put it so o side. Please do some changes and make the message icon easily available on the screen also. I hope you will make improvements in your next update...please do itðŸ™
No doubt..it serves a lot during this pandemic situition...but when i try to join..it shows failed to join meeting..i m not able to attend my classes.....please reply what to do..
"Nice app. More secure But, Zoom is better"
Plz add manual rotate screen option
Bla bla done
It's a nice and a cool Aap but sometimes I face problems while using this Aap
You should include noise cancellation option. This will be very usefull.
Nice but not very good
Add screen share
Unfortunately I am unable to join or conduct meeting in my android 5.1 device. Actually the app got installed successful but when I try to join meeting the app gets stopped. Kindly resolve this problem as soon as possible.
Low video quality and echo are coming
"I like the features for this app on PC or laptop, but I mainly use my iPad for my classes and it would be much better if you added things like grid view and blur background on mobile devices aswell."
Sometimes if you try to keep it in the background it closes unexpectedly.
Add a button to enter in full-screen mode!
Google meet is too good
pls add dark mode
Good to use.
Can't i get the recording facility
Can't join any meeting through my phone!! It usedto work fine before but now it's just gone bad I tried installing it again and again but it just isn't working!! ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜¡ I have to use other devices or apps instead which is not really possible when using it for online classes!! Pls fix this problem ðŸ™‚ All fine Now & everything is good but picture quality sometimes gets out of hand ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

"Awesome , and usefull for all smart phone users"

"It's good. But here is some privacy problems. Not any details of teachers and students. Anyone can join it. And disturb the class. And also rejoin the meeting after removing any participant. It's need to give details to the teacher like gmail I'd , number, etc."
Good app

It was a good app for any office video call please give that opption that was to change the name
It's is good but needs some Update in the Application
"I have been using this app for quite a while and I really like it. It's secure and very responsive. The U.I. is average when compared to my previous application, Zoom. It has lesser features than the other conference apps. But Google meet is often introducing new and fresh updates to level the other competitors. One of the features I miss was push to talk ( for which I had to download a seperate third party extension), grid view, virtual background, private chat and statistics."
Hey I love your app but I have a problem it's too laggy and my internet is fine I don't know what is happening 4 stars
Good app for meeting and online lecture

It's pretty good and much easy to join or create meeting through it. It also have several other functions related to online joining. Online work became much comfortable by this..
"Please Make This App As Zoom ,And Make This App Usable For Meetings."
"Good App ,the main thing is it is secure no bad people can enter but there is option for the host to turn off the chat box .As the students cannot meet each other during this pandemic when they do class they wants to chat but they cannot as the teacher mute that option.So I will tell to remove that option."
Good app for any online classes or any meeting.....but i have given it 4stars because sometime it's camera is hanging and that camera don't on untill anyone speaks.......
Aa gara google calss ha na us ki waga say meru class hoi ha
Great n clear video
"So helpful, u can count on it for any meeting weather it is something official or personal . From my personal experience, if I could change something about this app that would be, getting audio track while presenting the screen"
Some times I get failed to join in meeting
need dark mode option
Meetings can be more clear. Otherwise it's a good app. There should be effects and filters
I have a doubt... We're conducting an online webinar on October 2nd ... So we're planning to conduct it in the presence of about 200+ peoples... Is there any thing to do in additional to participate/add more than 100 peoples...we can't afford to take the risk by testing this new update ... That's why I'm asking for help !
Ok
This app is usefull but the vidio cracking very much and every vedio is not visible so the occurrences is ro much but then also I like this app better then others app

It is really a beautiful app. But I have a problem . I want to blur my background . I have updated google meet . I have go to meet help but I do not found any option like blur your background.
This app is good and has the best meetings . I prefer to use this app. Only one problem why is the host able to disable chat?
It's a great app and I recently updated it but whenever I join with my mobile phone then full screen mode is not available which makes content little bit tiny. The previous version of meet was good in comparison to full screen mode.
Old version was far away better than this version
"Nice app,but it has a problem that sometimes it will hang up and stop working.I used to use this app every day with the same issues.please fix this,thank you."

"Uhm, this app is okay, but it's great if you add a split screen function"
"It's good, but there are no meeting memory/history option after ending meeting"
"The app is good to use. Two biggest challenges are, can't switch on the microphone and camera in the laptop. In laptop I can't install the app, since it is directly connecting to my gmail account where in G meet is installed or inbuilt, so i don't know how to give access to camera nor microphone. Second can't record the meetings. Tried all options, couldn't get through. Kindly help."
Good app for online classes and exams

"This google meet app is good for my online classes... just I have a problem. When I wait for like 5 mins to ask to join it basically in 5 mins says ""time turned out trying to ask to join"" or something, And when it says my mam literally comes to the class! And then when I again try to join, my mam says ""You're very late"" ðŸ˜”. Pls fix this problem (even if it isnt a problem)"
Good for online study but I give 4 star because it join very slow so fix this problem it is good at all things
It is a good app

I found it very useful...It does not consume much data which is the best thing about this app...But my only problem is that I am unable to update it whereas my friends could uptade it...So my only request is to give a solution... Otherwise its just super...And hey dont forget to fix my problem...!
Superb
Good learning ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
This app is nice BUT I have a problem. The problem is that it uses A LOT of data and battery. Battery is okay. But the data - it literally shows 1 GB used in one hour. That's literally so much and also I use Mobile data. So please solve the problem.. I will change my rating to 5 stars if this problem is solved. :)
Really nice app for meeting one problem is that meet should show hindi captions otherwise it is a perfect app
Biggest meeting
Sandeep

Nice app
It is awsome... But when I updated it... This app is not opening after that update..... I m not being able to attend my online classes ... as whenever I open this app... My internet doesn't work at all
Very good app but it seems that there were some queries (1)No dark mode for eye protection Google please add it (2)If you have to change your info then you have to change your google account info (3)If you open any app while meeting you will be left from the meeting (4)No personal chat option That's why i gave it 4 stars
ðŸ‘Nicely

Good for online class.
Great app I liked it but the problem is it stucks a lot
Good
Google meet is a great app !! but i dont like the latest update is there a way in which I can get the previous layout ??
"The latest version is Very bad. It is not perfect like the last one. If I chat with someone, then it always crashes. Please bring the previous version again. Google meet was the best meeting app in mobile(I thought). But now.....ðŸ˜ž. Google team please solve this issue. I am unable to do my classes properly. But as it was best, I am giving 4 stars. Please reply me. Thank you for your patience."
We cannot private chat ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
"I feel like the names in the chat should be a different colour to the actual typed text to recognise the message better. Other than that, it's really helping with online learning."
Such a great app but there are some problem in it
It is very nice app But when while attending meet in between it ask for rewew of audio video but when we press back button it make us out of meet Thank u
"Good app works fine. Only thing on popup camera smartphones it opens and closes the camera everytime you join a meeting, regardless if you have it on or not."
Good aap
"Please make the recording feature for all because many people are having their online classes in this app and the teachers cannot record the meeting.So,the students can't see the meeting after the end of the meeting"
Very good app
It's good
Good
ncy class app is a veary bandarful aap
This is a very nice app but there is some problems that has to be fixed like that I get automatically left and after lefting also my name is there in the list.
Good app...
Good
Very good app....... I will rate it 5starif they give personal chat..... There is only group chat available in meeting if you could please add personal chat it would be the bestðŸ‘ðŸ’¯
In nxt update can you bring dark mode & split screen mode in Google meet
The chats are invisible
Google is always best but the problem is whenever i leave class it always asks me to rate please keep a option that ''only once we have to rate it''
Always I get class but 2 I do not get class
Very good
60 minutes time limit is worst... but all the other things are good...
one star less because whenever I type in chat box the notification disturbs or annoys me everytime when someone enters or leaves the meet so i want that you should fix that notification system
Try adding delete comments option
"It is very good I say..... But do you know, again and again ðŸ˜¶ it asks for the feedback and unfortunately we loose the meeting. It feels as if it you are thrown out of the meeting. There are many facilities available in the meet . Like we can clear doubts or we can converse with everyone present there. But I think it should get fourstars. It is good and ok with four stars"
Good working
Its very help full
Good
It is far more better than zoom and other meeting apps the only problem is that when a call comes even if I don't attend the call I will automatically leave the class . And the video is always blurred . Hope you can fix it google. Other than that there is no other problems I have had with the application.

This app is amazing.I am student and it gave me a nice experience for online classes. But now all people mike will be working but I cant hear any one I knew it when I used another mobile
Pls include a robotic beep while turning on and off the mic and camera
Everythings nice but there are two things 1. We cant see or send chat while someone is leaving or joining. 2. Can u add another feature like controlling mike with headphones buttons?? Its very helpfull when someone uses laptop and all.
ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
"Good for any meeting but there need more feature like dark mode , easy recording etc."
This app is very good but I think I don't like that in the pc there was many extra features than in mobile app please give this features in mobile app
The app is very good but only 100 people can join in it

It is good but some time it comes that 'unfortunately meeting has stopped'
I have a one question plz help me how to present screen video with audio..
"Amazing app from google as always <3 For the devs, > Mic button is too close to the disconnect button, and no confirmation on disconnect. I disconnected accidentaly few times while trying to quickly unmute my mic. > Sometimes a screen share which is not manually pinned gets lost, would be great if I could see all videos/screenshares of all the people in one place to manually pin a specific one."

Really have a good experience but only 100 students can join when this problem will solve and join 250 students
Things to improve the app: - Break rooms - Hand sign to speak - Everyone entering a meeting on mute tbh (maybe an option for the owner of the meeting)
I think this can be better but over all it is good enough.
Very nice app for video calling and meetings. But there should an option of reply privetly. But it is a nice app.

When we call through video it becomes very hazzy . And it takes 90% of the daily data. Please reduce the data usage. Otherwise it's a good a6o for meeting.

I can't find dark themes Exept all is good

I like it But storage space running out
It stops often
GoodðŸ‘ðŸ‘
"Please revert the update on ui...last was much better. Minor improvements are great. But I think meet history is missing. Messaging made difficult. Screen space reduced. And on large meeting continues left and joined participents cause to hide name of the presenter. And you have to stop take reviews right after the meet end, Which is really frustrating ( if u really want Please provide a review button )."
Good
One of the best app for video chat and phone meeting.
Dear developer please add floating window futures.
"Was a bit confusing at first, but it just takes time to understand."

ðŸ’“ðŸ’“
"Hey! This app is very much helpful for me. But my opinion is to please add the 'virtual background' feature in it. It must be very helpful and enjoyable to have a background in a meeting. Please add this feature, please."
I want to give it 5 star but i gave it 4 star because we cannot talk personal with someone if we write something personal to send message someone then that message everyone can see..... that's why i gave it 4 star if they join personal chat then I can give them 5 star because except this everything is good
Gud
It's helpful
Can you please put the leaving notifications of the other participants some where else in my classes when people leave i cant type in the chatbox
This app is very good for class and meeting. But there is one problem that sometimes its server will become slow even after having full internet and it takes too much time to send link or join the meeting.
On Okisr
Many times when my meeting is going on it comes meet isn't responding And I also sometimes can't hear the host Just fix this bugs otherwise it's a good app Thanks to give me an answer I'll try that also
"One of my advice to google meet team is that,they will have to allow our earphone button to control the mute and unmute option of Google Meet during meeting because while attending the meeting on Google Meet we have to mute and unmute our self again and again. So if Google Meet team allow us then it will be easy for us to interact rapidly while meeting."
This is a good app but the microphone is not open i try again and again
Mantap
Msst
"A clean meeting application with easy controls .But Not awesome video quality, no touch controls and no option of deleting message sent on the chatbox . Please add that if I press the button on my earphone the mic turns on and off."

It is the best app for meeting and for classes but there is a bug that no one is removing but it shows someone remove you and you should make a option that if someone remove us and we want to join then the person who made the code should agree we join or not . Thnks
You have to add confirmation message before leaving meeting
Good
"The app is good but sometimes while presentations are going you have to change orientations continuously to see the presentation on the screen , the screen goes blank sometimes except this small bug everything is excellent"
Everything is good in google meet but one thing u must add is there is no private chat there is only 1 common chat so pls add private chat

"A really good application for conferences, I must say it's damn good! A lot of people can connect at the same time , the video and audio is also good as compared to other applications that I was using. But I couldn't give five stars because sometimes if there's a network issue then at that time the captions help a lot but most of the times, while attending classes , the captions are not able to cope up with the speaking speed of the speaker. But still good job guys! And thanku for this appâ¤ï¸ðŸ™"

Nice app video is clear voice is clear and never crashes using for my online classes........ But UI needs to be much better...........
This app is the best meeting app. We are taking our online class from Google Meet but there is a small request that a new feature should be added to this app. Raising hand option should be available as of now we should shout in the middle of the class if we have any doubts. I hope you will bring this feature.
"App is good but the webcam turns off when changing tabs. Its troublesome when having proctored tests. Hope you can fix this, if not please allow it to be open for multiwindow."

"Edit: Thank you for reverting on the previous issue. It is fixed to an extent. When I am on Google Meet PHONE, every time someone leaves the meeting, the notification pops right in front of the text bar, rendering it impossible to type. Please look into it. The ""left the meeting"" should pop up somewhere else. On PC, the notification appears in front of the captions, blocking its view. That is also an inconvenience."
ðŸ‘
There is no annotation option ..plz add that too
Good app but will be more better if made things easy like changing in meeting name or profile picture etc.

Hey! So yea I like this app. It good. But recently all my calls are transferred to gmail. I dont like the UI and the presentation of it. It makes me feel im on a phone..Not much can be seen or done to adjust. I tried changing themes but of no use. I cant move to full screen. It has a dark theme and a simple UI ... still feels dull and limited!
Not bad..
I give it 5star but it sometimes irritate me.it automatically closed even the mobile data is on
plz remove it from gmail plz because it disturbes me alot
Very bad Very much big ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ bad

Sometimes it is not good enough for the next time I see it on your way home from work and I have to go back to the gym today and I have no idea where it is not good enough reason to be a good app is that a lot of people in my head is pounding on the way to go to the gym now and again I will be there in about an inch and a little more than anything else to go back to the gym today I am not sure what to do it for me too baby and I'm not going anywhere today is the first time in the world many haaa
I am giving 4 stars. This app is good and working nice but when I am attending class every time and every five minute it's asking rate us its disturbing me wile class please check it .this one problem only.
Every time 1 messege was come i will left plese something went wrong to this app
Good

Super lagging
"I have been using Google Meet in my mobile from quite a time . It has come to my notice that the battery drained very fast.The app drains about 30-40% for three hours .Also , the phone gets heated up . This is maybe a mobile related issue (I am not much of a expert in this field) but if any step can be taken , it would be highly appreciated."
But when there is an special meeting sometimes It asks for rating But it is a very nice app for video conferencing and online study or education
Please include the nod google meet extension for the online classes in this android-based app. Thank you!
Better bring dark mode
I can't use this applicatio
Nice n useful
Great app for online classes like the audio and video quality
Please allow google meet to record audio in device whatever be discussed in meating.This will help us to record the lectures of teachers and also imporatnt lines for others during meeting time.
Good but takes too much of internet
Its a good app for video call great quality everything are great but one feature you jave to add is that you should add a private chat in the chat list everyone can see the message's in the public please add private chat that will be great for us
It's a good app
Good
Nice meeting app for students. Audio and video are good. I recommend to use this app than zoom. But features are less compared to zoom. But otherwise a good meeting app.
Keeps on asking ratings in middle of presentations. That's the only problem for me.
Rishabh Î±Å˜YÃƒ it's application good for online study nice.......so nice
I think this app is better than because i consumes less mobile data but gives good quality
Please add private chat
Good app
"Really helpful App. But, you should add the theme which is in Gmail Meet. PleaseðŸ™ðŸ™"
Good
"This is a good app but when we recive call this end the meeting so, please solve this issue"
"Heyyy google Just a suggestion. Why don't you keep the messages throughout the meeting. If by chance someone's gets out of their meeting then they loose the information in the chat box. Look upon this matter, which would enhance the otherwise good appðŸ™‚"
Works great but private chat is missing great bummer
Could be better.....
"Hey, a good app but lost connection"

Important for students
"It is a great platform to use, but there is an issue recently, it says, ""sorry we encountered a problem/error while joining the call"" and takes me a lot of time to join a meeting even though I have superfast internet which I have tested by google itself. This makes it very tedious and I will be late for my meetings. If this issue is fixed it will be perfect."
"Video quality is not good, very bad"
It is very good app. But when it's updated version comes it leaves the metting again and again by itself by asking question 'how is the audio and video? ' so plzz correct it.
Madesh k r
Very nice app. I like it but just one problem sometimes the video pause or it will be blur. But it is nice.

This app is good.
"Don't show the pop up of how the video audio is!!!!!! ,"

Nice app
Good experience except voice glinches sometimes

As usual Google provides best application in every field but still many apps lacks basic features which forces as to go for an alternative.Like Meet should have an inbuilt video recorder so that we have to not rely on any other third party apps. Rest all features are fine and works very well.Please provide a inbuilt recorder as soon as possible and also Jamboard should be integrated with Meet for better presenting.(Jamboard also needs to improve a lot).
Help please I want meetings on this app but wen I click on the link I joined from Gmail. But this is a nice app
"There is a problem of screen resolution in this app. In my phone, some part gets cut even in full screen, please fix it."

I think google meet is best app for online teaching.This app has many feature such as screen presenting comment.But the only thing I dont like is there is no feature of seprate chat or if there is a double screen feature it will be a fanastic app.
Can you add a dark theme please tell ðŸ¤—. When I open Google classroom and click the video button then it opens in Gmail insted in meet ðŸ¤”
This application is good for meeting but there should be double tap back feature. I urge to developer to add this
I have give only four stars because one less give because when my last meeting then voice is not coming and double voice coming
So nice app . We can do anything . Due to network some problems are there but it is a good appðŸŒŸ.

Because I use
I think you should improve the app like anyone can mute or unmute others mike and more
Google plz add recording option.........
"Please enable split screen function , it will be really helpful , otherwise the app is nice!! , All the best team"
Please don't ask review
"It is good app ,but more time i stay in video means suddenly i go to chat box or any other means ,video was stop and it will exit.."

Why won't mine update?
But can you please add to split the screen
Plzz add the grid view in the app becuz i dont see my other classmates in the session plzz do it in next update then i will give you 5 stars
Sounds well
es buena pero en ratos se corta al hablar o se escucha eco tambien se traba pero sobre todo eso es buena
Better than zoom tbh. This has better audio quality. Would rate it 5 but lag makes me crazy.
Not bad
Good app with good features.
Good
"It's a good app for meeting, but it's audio quality should be improved"
Its great
This app is so bad. You dont get good video quality in this app and all you see is a blur. The audio also buffers a lot and presentation is slow to update as compared to other video conferencing apps. You cant mute participants permanently and you have to keep clicking on each participant's profile to mute them. There are so many other problems as well. When you accidentally click on BACK then you immediately leave the meeting which is also not good. I have already given multiple feedbacks.
A good one.....helps me alot during corona to attend classes and is really niceðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š bt a problem in this is that it does take alot of net
It is good app
Best for online class and lectures
The app's performance is really good but I hope you can have an option to unflip our face in the video. Pleaseeeeeeee
Nice for meating
This So good App But Some Many Bugs are there... Ex: Voice I'm send that group received for Voice 1(Or)2Minitues later... May be Update And fix for bugs The App Wii be run Smoothly And the people Using for the best quality Thank you....
It's Very stable platform..in ths pandemic it's helping a lott during online classes.. But after updating its taking huge a large space.. Plz sort out Some times technical problems wll occur And the audio presentation is taking time and audio is reaching late. ...
Very good working aap i using this app almost 6 month is very nice experience in this app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Video is not clear
I can't join my class. Except me all my friends can join but not me. Please do something I don't want to miss any class as its my first year. Thanks its working now. Why didn't I gave 5 star. Because of very bad video quality.
ðŸ‘
Its good and secure
It would be great if you give a direct access to google meet from google classrooms without installing google meet as a separate app
When i present screen for youtube its audio is not received to other
Well
Gd
it is a video Confrence app
Jiin
"Good app overall, I actually have zoom and meet but i think meet is better, since it has comment sections and allows you to see all other members of a meeting without swiping tghe screen too much, my only problem is with some of the bugs in the app, mainly sound, my students usually complain they cant hear me properly(I'm a teacher) but other than that the app works fine"
It is very useful
Nice app

There should be an option to mute the participants and those people who are denied once to join the meeting can't join the meeting again.
Google meet is a very good app

Hi ! I am using Google meet in this month and this app is better compare than any other apps but my problem is video and sound quality is very bad.l am using the app in one month.this problem solved and l am any other problem on this app..
Google why the mobile app does not show the session expired. I have my org account given from school which had expired but I didn't knew and couldn't join any meeting. I would like Google to add a tag (session expired) near the account name. So that I could easily identify and re login as soon as possible and enter the meeting.
"I love this app! This is the perfect app instead of zoom for phone with under 3 or 2GB RAM But, I have an idea for the next update. Can you add dark theme for this app, please?"
Very useful to us to learn education tq so much for giving this app absolutely gd to use

Fine
It's good. But I wish there would be nod reaction for the app version so that those students who only use their phone like me could also respond to our teachers using the nod reaction.
User friendly which is most important . Good to use
"Its excellent app but , some times it shows that someone removed u from the meeting ... Why ? No one removed ... But it shows .... If u can patch up this problem , i must give you 5 ðŸŒŸ stars ... And everything is extremely good"

I am a student only four star beacause some times it is sound break and i can't lishen proppely but this app is excellent app to study online in 2020
"The app is good. But I have to tell something Whever I rotate my phone to landscape mode, the network starts buffering, and the audio will be also breaking.Google, please find a solution."
This app is ok but is will there be an update when we can simply add virtual backgrounds on the app for our meetings.
Hi Google Kindly provide us with a solution to enable split screen mode on phones wherein we can open gmeet as well as another app. This is going to help students to open their exam paper on one app and show themselves doing the paper on gmeet simultaneously.

"This app do not support split screen , that is the only problum."
"I m taking online class, It's good for online classes to conduct But if u had chat enabled and disabled option is better for us ..."
Tihs is really helpful app for online classes and meetings
The app's quite good! There's even an option to mute everyone so I can just do that and play games while having classes! Though there's one thing if I'm writing a message and someone joins the notification/message appears right on it so i can't send it and can't even click on the bar. Its a little troublesome :/
Video and adio is so good
Very very wonderful app
It is helpful but if there is recorder it will be more helpful . please add recorder ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘

Good app for only online classes
"First of all this app is best for online classes. But when teachers ask something important right then the rating thing comes. That's the big problem. And I am submitting this 4 stars only because I get again and again ratings. But overall this app is very good,but if you can then please fix this rating thing."
Wow Very nice app
Little bit network problem
It is a good app for online classes
Good
Best
It's a nice one for online classes
Poor captions
Google: It would be better if the option to record meetings is added in the mobile version.
Small and major suggestion when pressing back button just try to show Exit confirmation buttton add pop-up to Exit Without confirmation When i pressed back botton Existing from online class so much off Irritating Try to fix this problem
Best app ..... I loved its eveything but its screen freezes after every 1 min non touched.
We need dark mode in Google meet ...... Please add this feature..
Too good
"As a teacher, want an upgrade where we can see whether students have went offline or are online on meet. Like a green or red dot besides their names, so that easily we can identify whether they are really active or not in the class."
Helpfull appðŸ¤˜
So nice man..
Enough good....
Mostly not worked Many times i have to delete it and downlod again due to not working
It's a good app from Google for online classes and meetings and better as compared to duo and zoom but it works perfectly on my mom's phone samsung galaxy j8 but not on oppo neo 5. Every time I try to join it displays the meeting screen for a second or 2 and then leaves. I tried reinstalling and restarting but in vain. Please help Google.

Good app. But it doesn't provide any option to raise hand or to disable chat
Fine app you gotta improve more like+ white board
Nice app it is useful app
Waste But good app
It's good and helpful app now-a-days. But when I am using this app the rating chart appears and when I select the option not now it used to exit from the meeting. Then I have to again rejoin the meeting. Please make sure this.
It is better than zoom but sometimes it shows error . I hope that. Google will resolve it fastly.
Would love if I could access from email on my tablet similarly to how I can accesd from my in box on the phone. I love the closed caption feature. As I learn more my appreciation grows
Love ir

Good luck

Good app
Its an awesome app for meetings but can you add two features that i think we all require A. Add a raise hands button so that when teacher is not on the meet tab she can no if a student has typed a doubt. B. Can you add sharing images in the chat section It would be a good feature.
"Sometimes has connectivity issue but over all app is quite helpful, decent and good. Excellent for meetings and school purpose all."

It was my first experience in Google meet it was very helpful for my online class because sometimes it disconnects me from the call please fix this problem!!
Is great but the teachers can't use it and have a call where only 10 people can join so one of the classmates couldn't join so the teachers removed emails from group thinking it would make room to join the call

It is very simple to use and works fine most of the time as long as you have stable internet. The video and audio quality is decent and no significant delay. It would be even better if plugins are present for app as they are for PC version.
Good app
This is best
Nice
Very nice app and safe for our studies just add some more features in presenting screen like annotations and all rest it's ok
Bagus!
Ha ha ha ha ha
You should add the settings like we can chat with other people personally....like the settings given in zoom..... otherwise the app is excellent....hope you will add that feature too...ðŸ˜â˜ºï¸
"I got the new update and the older Google Meet did not work properly. The host's voice was cracking, etc."
"Hope you add grid layout for the users joined in the live meeting, so that can see all of them"
Good
It is good but pls stop notifying me in the middle of my class the meeting also ended when it comes
Best app for vedio confrecing without any obstacle.
Good
"It's all good but when I am in meetings it always show, rating options for app again and again after every 15 minutes. Even I gave full star or not it disconnect me from meeting please fix this issue"
You guys should fix the notification that says if a person joined the meet or left because it blocks the chatbox and it sometimes interrupts me when I answer my teachers question because the notification stops me from typing or sending a message
"It's Nice but the fact that While sharing screen on mobile it doesn't shares internal audio takes away the whole good experience, I'd love if the developers add that functionality."
"I love this app, but I would like to see an advanced update more into this app. Current features is great, but i would like they add more. Design better than ever, this app very very useful in this hard time. Hope they update more"
Some time net issues are coming.
"Good, video & audio quality are ok"
Plz give a option record meetings

"A few suggestions, so that our User Experience knows no bounds. These are as follows : 1. Please give the organiser a function of unmuting people. 2. Please give the organiser a function to present screen that superceeds others presentation and which cannot be overlaped by any other user trying to present. 3. Please rename the Present Screen to Share Screen as people get confused that it states them as Present in front of those attending. 4. Recording meeting through Phone for Gsuite Account."
Good very app Google meet
Plz increase the number of peoples in a single meeting
Initially it was going all well but from past 3 days whenever i get link for meet up and i just tap on it my network goes off and therefore i am able to join only via gmail not directly via meet app . Please help me to figure this out

Nice app
Nice app
I have been using it for my classes. My experience is that it is relly a nice app but sometime the people whom we not know enter in between the classes even we have not shared the link with them. They will just disturb us in many classes.
It is very good app for who are spend time on online meeting. But only drawback is that while using in mobile if I press back key it automatically leave the meeting...pls do the corcnern..lots of my friends face this problem
"It's really good except it has one downside, whenever a person joins or leaves the meeting, you type anything in chat because the button used to open keyboard for chat gets hidden due to the pop-up of someone joining or leaving the meeting."
"Good,but voice & video is not clear"
"It was all good with the app but recently I'm facing some issues regarding joining meetings. Whenever I click the provided link to join the meeting, it starts opening in Gmail and not in the Meet app. I'm unable to figure out what is the problem with new updated version of Meet app. Please give me a solution to this."
I will give 4 star because of ads coming after the mettting and it come always

Hey this is a good app as per as the latest version is considered.But there is an issue that there is echo of my voice in a particular meeting everyday.Rest other meetings go well. I request Google to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
Its Very Good App For Online Class .Please Add Ping
"Good, but need little more accuracy and updation..."
Please include a screen recording option. Just like in Zoom cloud meetings. It will be beneficial for us.
"It's Good app but Couldn't achieve Cancellation of background sounds, and couldn't see all participants on mobile, why. And it was difficult to show videos. Also it was not possible to record video while on video chat. Help me"
"Very useful for online classes. I request Google to update this and the next version should contain these following features. 1) Let the host disable screen sharing. 2) When sharing screen, the voice should be clear. Only these two are very effective for the Google meet. I appreciate Google that you made such wonderful app for meetings."

This app definitely requires a lot of improvement. It is very uncomfortable to use the app. There needs to be choices for the users. The only reason people continue to use Google Meet instead of other apps is because of the trust people have in Google and also the convenience of linking Google Meet with other services provided by Google.
Perfect

It is a good app. I am using it since 7-6 months for my online school. But there are some bugs which can be fixed. As soon as I updated my Gmail. My all the meetings started opening in Gmail. Everything is fine there but the user interface of meet is better than Gmail. So please allow us to choose Google Meet for meets rather than Gmail. Or you can simply ask whether to choose Gmail or Google meet. So we can choose which we want....

"This app is very helpful in conducting classes through online. I am thankful for that. Everything is good except one. That is blurring during online streaming with book notes.(Not screen presentation). I think the problem is with network. The upload and download speed is not good. The provider are not providing the speed properly. Dont know why in India. Many teachers and students facing this problem. Requesting to rectify this problem, so that with less or moderate strength we can watch clearly"

I had given it 5 stars but after some time it always needs feedbacks by the duration of every 5 minutes and when I give it any type of feedback ;the meeting stop; it should need restart and till than some time of meeting l lose.

This app is fantastic. As expected from Google. But there is not any option to record the meeting except the admin. This is very annoying. There should also a feature for everyone to record the meeting.
This is very useful and nice app but the battery get low very fast and data also finishes very very fast in just 30 min
We need options in the app to view the photo or documents it will much better to attend the class
This app is very useful for studying but please make sure that it should contain split screen for online exams .
