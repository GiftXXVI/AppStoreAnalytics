Because of cuties #stopnormalizingpedos
App wont even open.
promotes pedophilia
Its dumb asf
Wat happen to netflix? why is it that the app does mot continue to open?
It has been more than a week since we can not open Netflix. It was working fine more than two weeks ago and then all of a suddenly we have a Netflix screen with red rotating circle that will never open up to a screen of available movies and shows. Amazon Prime is working great so I know it's definitely not the problem with the TV but Netflix programming.
Ingt kn x yah byar rupa2 nya kna bayar adoii
why i cant log in... it starts yesterday after update.. pls fix this issue
Doesnt work properly. Fix issues with regional content
I cannot connect to the server i already uninstall reset and all devices from laptop to phone cannot connect. I tried to contact via support even the web is down. Then they charge me yesterday. Annoying
"I use to think this was good, but then they made cuties and removed that 70s show and parks and recreation. I now hate this app, it is a vile waste of money"
Old movies are posted and in by episodes always not complete.
Netflix is running out of ideas so they're allowing anything to be added to Netflix library to compete with other steaming apps. Little girls twirking and dirty dancing should not be allowed just to make money and appeal to pedophiles.
Bring back open season please please bring back open season
Only seeing black screen after the update. Why so?
They took off my favorite show Charmed and the only thing is the stupid remake thats a joke. I waited all year to watch it in October and they do this. PUT THE SHOW CHARMED BACK ON NETFLIX
Locks me out must continuously delete data to play
Customer care sucks waiting close to an hour to reset password. half the times my request goes to a lost page. You pay your money you forget your password then they forget about you color me pissed off
Terrible since update

Not a big fan of pedophilia
Latest update has critical bug... Cannot use the app on my Android.
You are the best

Bruh why does the update take so long....
Not interested in Netflix - content has declined dramatically with inappropriate material. Cancelling my subscription also.

Worst experience ever
"""We cannot reach the netflix service""for the fourth time ,I heard this has some good shows so I installed it then this happened..So disappointing this dont deserve even one star.Fix it I just want to want anime movies Please!!!!!"
Crashing a lot and not opening
"I have a problem when i start watching anything an error pops up saying ""there is a problem playing the video, please try again (5.10)"" i have tried everything and its still not working"
after the update every movie or shows started to show green screen. I have checked the network but it is showing the same problem.
Good
"On s20+ netflix looks blurry compared to mate 10 pro, lacks the sharpness in details and looks like a crt image quality compared to the fine 4k details on the 3 years old huawei phone, same account, same wifi, same profile, same display settings, same download, battery and all the other hidden/non-hidden settings"
Not working
Boring no cool movies like jarguar power
Won't load
Cuties.
I've been a fan of Netflix for a long time and used it both on my phone & my laptop. Until this update. Because now the only thing I see when I open the app is 'can't connect to Netflix - retry'. So keep in mind that the service itself is great but the up (at least right now) is just a very big bug. I'll keep one star till the problem is solved - if it will be.
Does not work.. Not letting me log in to my new account... Keeps switching off for no reason!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Add gcash as a payment method. Not all uses postpaid number, not all links their credit card and debit cards on their phone. THANKS!"
Costly
"I keep getting the error "" Too many login attempts"" . live chat asked me to wait 6 hrs i waited. I called they asked to wait 48 hrs, i still waited and yet having the most expensive plan, i am not able to use it on my device. Completely Disgusted and Upset. Cancelling all plans and gonna try watching it free somewhere else. Because after paying 900 pm i am still unable to watch, whats the use.. sorry bhai abhi main chalta hunðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™"
It has more problems since the last update. The screen freezes in between the video.
Facing problems. Sometimes it is getting stuck in middle of the video after the update
i cant download for offline
My account is Hacked. Hacked. Hacked. Hacked. Hacked. Please help. Or else I will sue you. Netflix is a fraud.... I will drag you to the court of law if I am not replied in the next 24 hours.
"After the recent update, I have lost the search icon from the app. I can not search any title. Only browsing through recommendation page. Fix it"
If you have a Huawei phone with Google play services like the p30 and mate 20 you will only get audio and no picture it's not worth downloading if you have a huawei
"As an Indonesian premium customer, your servers sucks. Running fine on the morning, but struggling at prime time to even reach HD even more UHD, on a 50mbps internet subscription."
they stole that 70s show from us
Deception it's doesn't work ðŸ˜• on my phone
"Extremely costly Very poor customer care, wasted my two hours but no solution from customer care and above all they all are unskilled and can guide you only as per steps given on Google, extremely unskilled and unable to understand the problem, poorest customer care with such a expensive subscription chargex."
"This thing I dont know first it was working in English language but after some days, I opened it the language changed to other language,which I dont understand,so I uninstalled it then I again installed it but still the language is different. plz help me Netflix"
After the update it pop out we could not reach the the service try again later(-1023) what happened Netflix? Pls. Fix this problem or i might gonna cut the plan.
"What good is Netflix now? No Parks and Rec. No Friends, no Rules of Engagement. News flash, Seinfeld sucks. Everybody loves Raymond sucks. I might just be done at this point."
It is so useless
"14 days before the subscription end,asking for payment. Also content can not run"
L1 but in the app L3. Bug fcvk
"Worst, I have been a fan of Netflix. Now when I am trying to install it in new phone, it is asking for the account credentials. Then the app crashes. I tried to install it 3-4 times because the app was so good. But this makes me disappointed."
After recent update video don't get forwarded...it got still at that particular scene even after repeatedly pressing forward button.
Pagal app
Supports Pedophilia. Unsubscribed
"PLEASE ALLOW US TO PAY EASIER. Some of us cannot pay using credit cards. Please let us pay through GCash, Paymaya, etc."
Horrible
"My app doesn't show any visuals, the only thing i have is audio but not visuals"
Please add rupay dabit card
"This was a great app and a great service with great shows, until... They just started filling up their lists with awful shows and continue to remove all time favorites. First to go was Dr. Who, then Always Sunny, then Archer, then 30 Rock, now Parks and Recreation is gone, they delete, delete, delete. BOO! I'm supposed to pay $8.99/mo just to watch the Office and have 1 or 2 decent documentaries? If there is a current show you're into, they don't add the new episodes for about a year."
"I have Oppo neo 7, and I can't to login Netflix account..! , it's not support in my phone..!"
Can't sign in
"Myself paaide far membarsheep and naat geeting tha ""net"" onlay"

Keep forcing close when I'm going to choose email for log in :(
"Video freeze, cannot connect to server, random crashes... The new update seems to be very unstable... I can't watch a 20min episode without it crashing or the video freezing... Also sometimes the app won't launch. Not to mention the progress of where I left on an episode/movie is incorrect. Please fix these things!"
After app update video Play back getting freeze. Every time I need to forward and backward play back to watch videos. Even though it's getting freezing. I'm totally disappointed by Netflix update.
Utterly crashing after update... Can't even do proper 10second forward.
"Screen black out while in full screen.. But when in small window, it shows pictures."
I'm sorry I don't like it very much issue problems

Backwash app he ye... Gmail account sing in hi nahi hota aisa app hota he kiya
They NEVER have the movies I want to watch. They should have every movie that's not in the theaters on here. Thinking about canceling my subscription...waste of money! Plus Netflix is becoming very liberal!!!
Price keeps going up up up content keeps going down down down. And what's with all the forgien content and no way to filter it out.
Didn't accept my payment using my phone billing
"Netflix has been decent throughout the years but when you exploit underage girls, that is disgusting. Canceled membership."
"Hard to believe Netflix can't do HD on a Google Pixel Slate tablet running Chrome OS, this needs to be fixed"
if u want to support child pornography then this is the right choice for u. if your 100% against it i suggest u delete netflix and never re-subscribe.
"Dear Netflix, I don't want the God Damn App. Let me watch what I am paying for on my phone or tablet without it. Go to f###ing hell."
This one star is for a Anne with an E for not renewing it for the 4th season.
"Love Netflix but right now it's impossible to watch on my Galaxy Tab A. Perpetually on the Nexflix screen, can't even choose my account. Extremely frustrating. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!"

"Facing Crashes, glitches and buffering issues (experiencing this first time) after recent updates.."
Hey Netflix ! Want to survive in india ?? 1. Give 3Months/ Half yearly/Annual Subscriptions 2. 4K UHD Plan(Single Screen) at cheap price
This app locks phone brightness at 0. Completely unusable in a lit room or outdoors or a car during the day.
On TV this is great. On tablet or laptop it sucks
IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The latest update has resulted in me unable to open up Netflix on my phone. There's an error message when I try to open it from Google Play.
"Love Netflix, and I can not stand that the app controls the brightness on my phone when watching. It is almost completely blacked out. Can this be turned off somehow?"
"Get rid of ""cuties"""

Android 11 is updated Netflix are creating problems in my mobile OPPO find X2.
Cannot use this app without WiFi. Videos and thumbnails do not load unless I'm connected to WiFi even though my stream quality is on max cellular
I do NOT support a pro pedophilia company.
"Uodates are meant to resolve bug issues not to create them. Your last update exactly did what it shouldn't, video started pausing & glitches. Please resolve this, I'm hating my experience with this update."
"Very glitchy, always reverts back to first episode rather than follow numbers 1 2 3 4...it goes 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1"
Paise ki barbadi
ANDROID 11 INCOMPATIBLE - won't work on my Pixel 4A
"01/09/2020 - Latest update installed yesterday has caused my app to no longer work. 2 very long live chats later and still it won't work as they are still ""investigating"". Not good enough for a paid service!!! 08/09/2020 - 1 week has gone by and still the issue has not been fixed! 13/09/2020 - Another week gone by and still nothing. Disgraceful level of support!!! 18/9/2020 - app still not working!!!! You people are a joke!!! 30/09/20 and it's still not working!!!!! Pathetic"
"I was literally watching the movie ""Criminal"", 2016 release starring Ryan Reynolds and the quality suddenly dropped so I restarted Netflix and then I simply couldn't find the title. The movie was actually getting interesting and it's frustrating to know I can't watch it further. The customer service said that the title might have expired. Well it was in my list for a couple of months and if I would have known it's gonna expire I would have watched it earlier. This is disappointing!!"
This app is good but it so annoying it freezes when I'm watching something the audio only works but the video talks so much time to come on it's annoying
"Worst application , it's Dedicated my â‚¹ 750 without my permission."
Wrost app ever seen.... Amazon prime is hundred Times better....Netflix automatically renew packs and no option to return money....but Amazon prime gave you option to money back if you mistakly apply for auto renewal packs ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
awful
There is a problem with recent upgrades. While using fast forward or backward buttons frame get stuck. Only voice and subtitles are working. Please fix this Problem.
I refuse to use a streaming service that openly displays content for pedophiles; if I could vote negative stars i would.
After recent update screen freezes while fast forwarding 10 sec.
When i try to play a video it's not playing just loading...
"Why watching is paid?? If you earn from view as well why the subscription needs to be paid?? I don't get it please make it freee ðŸ™ I join both of hands stands on my knees ðŸ™‡ begging you, no no no not begging this would be wrong ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ but I swear if you don't give me a free subscription then you'll responsible if I'll do something with something â˜¹ï¸"
They removed the playback speed function which was crucial for my watching experience. This has made me v unhappy
"Team I wasn't expecting this, without my acknowledgement how can you take the money, I haven't enabled auto detection. This Sucks"
Gud

After updating app video are not playing properly
"Spam ""system"" app you can't uninstall. So fun being regularly forced to update an app I'll never use."
"I don't know what happen and why ?! i just updated my Netflix and suddenly i can't find my favorite tv show i just watched recently. i thought maybe i got the wrong title, so i google it and found my favorite tv show. funny thing is google suggest me to watch at Netflix, but guess what new Netflix update s*ck cause keep loading loading and then show nothing. the worse part is that tv show was in my list. after update the apps it's gone. d*mn it."
I had installed and uninstalled Netflix again and again in my realme 7 but it is not working properly. I received a pop up that can't connect to server try again.

Not a fan of kiddie porn. Netflix really screwed up letting the liberals run wild. Oh that's right it was filmed outside the usa so it's art.
"My phone's software updated, all apps is gone and I reinstall Netflix.. But I can't open it, its always close when I try to log in.. What happened?"
Why some of movie and web series aren't Available in Asia region so disappointed
Love the app
I cant turn on with phone number
Uninstalled due PEDO CONTENT.
"So I guess Netflix is taking down negative reviews. How very honest of you. First you promote pedophilia, now paying Google to take down reviews you don't like. Well I can keep putting them up. Inform us of what the update is BEFORE we agree to it. Not a you worry about other stuff. You have access to my phone I want to know what i am downloading"

Updated yesterday. Suddenly experiencing so many glitches today (which I'd never encountered any of these before) ðŸ˜ž Tried to double tap the screen to fast forward but the screen froze and the sound repeatedly play.

I will add, as paying costumers at least a description of the details of each updates would be appreciated."

Why Netflix not available for Android versions above 7? We have been using Netflix for almost a year and now it's not supporting devices with Android versions 7 above You guys can't expect us to accept pay and not use the app kind of stuff It's really heart breaking I think I need an explanation from you guys or a refund for my subscription

I want to delete the app but there is no delete.

I m not able to open netfix in my redmi Note 8 pro Please help me with this problem.. It shows sorry we could nit reach the Netflix service please try again later.(-1001)
Good app. Gets a one star until they take down that child porn. Unsubscribed as well!
"For the past one week I am experiencing some problems lately. Initially, I was unable to play in HD ( my device supports HD). Now, when I press forward the video freezes and audio gets played. My friends are also having the same problem."
"Your app will work on my phone but won't continue to play if I try to cast it to my smart tv. And the only reason I'm casting to my smart tv is because the app on the tv won't let me sign in. So at the moment I cannot watch Netflix at all unless I want to go back to the days of watching on a phone, and thats not happening."
Useless
"Me and my mother have been using Netflix for a very long time. And It has always been a great app for watching shows. Until today. Today Netflix said that the host account was invalid that id didn't exist. We have been loyal subscribers to this application for a long while and now we had to start a NEW account with the same OLD email address that they said no longer exists. We will be calling them soon. And if it some how gets resolved then I will remove this review. Until then, bad service."
...long time subscriber since... renting movies thru the mail. But I can no longer subscribe after watching part of CUTIES. Who TF thought the sexual exploitation of young girls would be a great thing to add to the list? I was absolutely repulsed and disgusted with the 15 minutes I tolerated. I do not typically get emotional about a controversial movie/show and I do not normally feel physically ill after watching most shows/movies. this made me feel like a pedo like I should be ashamed. Gross!
"I can't even register, not accepting my mobile payment."
"Everything is a black screen. They don't care about the mobile app at all. It constantly has problems, and it takes weeks for them to address the issues."
App is not getting download since from long tym.
Asian sever isn't enriched enough comparing to the us server of Netflix. HUGE DIFFERENCE! Like Death Note has no english audio in asia server or any other reason? Does netflix think that a huge portion of asia knows japanese? I don't think so. Asian server needs TREMENDOUS enrichments of shows and movies.
Child porn ..#SAVEOURCHILDREN
It barely works only sound never picture I never had hulu or prime do that wth fix it

"When netflix stops promoting pedophilia, I'll be back."
Buggy today. Needs update asap.
"Hi Netflix, it is my personal suggestion that if you are running here in india, you should provide shows or movies in local language also. It will be beneficial to us as well as u. Some of my friends are not interested to renew their membership due to this I am also among them."

That wasn't really good that was bad
Sorry not good
Always crashing before and after the update. You're expected to do better since users has to pay for your services. Customer care needs a lot of improving.
"Leaving no point having Netflix, the films if gives me are not anything I like, I have to go through so much I won't even watch two find one or two shows or films that it gone down hill and I found other options out there with same price better films to....."

Cant open the netflix app always device failure.
The liberal pervert's app.
Netflix has been told about my issue of no sound or not wanting to load any movie and the still won't fix it!
inappropriate movies
"I've had this problem for a while now where the screen is just blank when I watch something. The audio will be running and all the other functions work, I just can't watch whats going on. So, please fix this."
Recent update is causing screen freezing. While watching video if you try going forward or backward the video playback gets stuck
"I can't sign in and if it needs to be updated to sign in, I think that's stupid. I dont want to update these things. You'll already have too much of our information"
There is updates and it is really annoying
New update STUCK while doing forward or backward resolved soon
ðŸ‘Ž
After the new update that happened yesterday I uninstalled netflix and I installed it again today but I have a problem and it's whenever I open it to log in it shows me previous accounts I logged into and had already deleted them from my account and then the app closes and whenever I open it again it just does the same thing and at first I thought it was just my phone but then I realized it only happens with netflix
Kids porn

It keeps asking me if I want to continue watching a show while I'm watching a show
"The newest update has caused my app to crash or not to start at all. Please fix asap. I'm on long term sick, stuck in hospital and this is my saviour. Thank you."
"I love Netflix but I am not able to watch Breaking Bad. It works fine if I watch it on tv, but not my phone. It comes blank. Tried reinstalling. Nothing works."
Too slow...the movie keeps stopping...and most of the times when i restart the movie starts frim the beginning and not where u left it .
"WHY DID YOU CANCEL THE SHOW ""I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS"" NETFLUX WHAT ARE YOU ON THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT SHOW AND IT ENDED ON A CLIFFHANGER ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
They put an awful dosgusting movie on here. Disgusting #protest
Netflix does not have much anime on it it should have demon slayer dragon BALL Naruto black clover my hero academia bleach one piece high school dxd konosuba and many more just because we're in south Africa doesn't mean we should have less shows than Americans we all pay the same price so why don't we also have the same amount of shows
Not playing well
"App is crashing lately, specially when I forward it. New update required"
Won't let me sigh in to another device

"It is beyond annoying that I can't watch videos in portrait mode on my tablet. How hard could that be, Netflix? Hulu lets you. Consider that when deciding between Hulu and Netflix."
"After being with Netflix for 10 years I've cancelled due to their lack of morals in bringing a child pedophilia movie in ""Cuties"" to their platform. 4Chan has higher moral standards than Netflix and will ban anyone who posts any clips or photos of the movie along with contacting authorities. Why? Well you tell me I refuse to watch child porn."
Does not work properly since the last update!!

"Update created serious problems casting to a Chromecast. It's causing the volume settings of my device to be completely ignored and sound came blasting out of my TV at max volume at 11:30pm since I normally let the Chromecast control this. Thanks for that Netflix. I'm sure my downstairs neighbors loved that. No matter what I do, I cannot fix this. The cast button disappears and the screen scrolls over itself sometimes too. This is a truly terrible update if it can even be called an update."
Very expebsive
It has alot of bugs in it . Once if we fast forward five seconds the video gets either stucked or plays slowly doesn't go with the audio sync.
Pedophile netflix cuties
Good but recharge is not good.

Not working smooth with android devices
Recently the app keeps giving me failure to connect or netflix service not available errors. Quite frustrating. It did not do this prior to most recent update.
Unable to connect
"Darkness issue with Galaxy phones fixed. Kinda like cable, too many shows worth nothing on. Also, NO MORE ARCHER!!! That totally sucks. Have to seriously consider getting rid of Netflix. Netflix produced content, for the most part, just sucks. Sorry to say, after originally posting this, the original content from Netflix still basically sucks, actually it's getting worse. UPDATE: their original content still sucks."
Wont download to phone
Cuties enough said
"I recently update Netflix & now it keeps telling me ""cannot connect to the Netflix Server""....Try again later. But when I do try again later, it keeps saying the same thing !!"
I cannot even open my netlix. Whats wrong with it? Already install and uninstall many time. Not working
I have changed my gadget recently in which Netflix comes as inbuilt app.unable to update it from the play store it keeps rotating for days. All other apps I'm downloading and using normally.
NFLX supports pedophilia. Cancel your sub and let them know why.
"Despite having a paid subscription, I can not access from my phone. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still will not let me select my email address."
Nice app
gotcha everytime i sign into bldg 7 free app
"Very bad..waste of data,don't download"
"A ver, gente, a ver... Llevo meses sin poder abrir la aplicaciÃ³n, probÃ© de todo, pueden solucionar esto por vuestra parte? Yo ya hice todo de mÃ­ lado, ahora les toca a ustedes."
Even can't open on A31 Samsung
Love it
One star purely for the passive-aggressive dig at us in the update description.
I had to cancel my subscription once they started promoting child porn
(-14) Couldn't find service?????
No sÃ¬r kk
Bad
"I do not support the sexual exploitation of children. I also refuse to support any entity that supports such vile behavior (Netflix promoting ""Cuties""). My Netflix account has been canceled indefinitely!"
poop
Becareful of Netflix they are scammers and the Phillipinees will hack into the BANK system to override the system to unlock yout account so they can illeglly withdraw money out of your account and will lie and tell you your account has renewed even after you canceled it they will wait a few months and try and do it and they will try and deny it even after you prove to them that you caught them in their lies
Waist of time
"Keeps getting device error 500-116, followed by 503-116 and then unable to reach Netflix service -1001 error. After trying multiple times, App opening but the resolution is set to SD. Story repeats if I reinstall. My device is certificate with L1, but the app said my widevine certificate is L3. I have been tried manually change playback setting in account setting, but nothing changing. I have been tried to use other connection but nothing changing too."
No updated movies or TV shows
I really enjoy watching Netflix but I wish you guys could allow at least 3 TVs in to the price that we pay that will really help us out a whole lot because the money that we pay we are barely able to pay that price
"Stop making disgusting content, what is wrong with you Netflix, you guys would be jail, you should be in jail, not sure why your not in jail, not sure why you get a free pass, or how you get a pass, something is really wrong with the world if you can get away with what you do and no on says anything."
Never holds the place where I'm actually holding. Always starts a few episodes behind.
Netflix is life. But this phone app sucks. Everytime I start a show it just lags and gets stuck on the same scene but continues in audio and it's annoying af.
"The latest update broke the app. Pausing an episode and going back in brings up paused video with audio still playing. If I close the app from recent apps, it works for that time only. It starts all over again after that."
"Wish you'd have a more current selection of movies & shows. Take Cuties off, it's exploiting children"
stop with my phone!
The movie lineup is just terrible
Cuties = no
The app is not opening on the phone no matter how many times I restart my phone
"Horrible, before I uninstalled this app it was great quality, ect But when I reinstalled this a week later it doesn't let me in, it just says ""which smart lock are you using"" and when I press an option it just exit out of the application. I tried to do this, re install again but the results are always the same FIX YOU'RE APP"
It's stopped working on the Nexus 9. Please update the app Netflix.
I'm facing a strange glitch in the app it just keeps loading and doesn't play also I'm unable to see the thumbnails
Hi I'm ganya I did enter my app
Cuties
Need to change audio add Hindi audio
"When I click on the app, I just get a network error."
"Doesn't detect my Chromecast device when every other app on the phone detects it just fine. It's trying to be ""smart"" and hide the FAB for Chromecast when there isn't one on your network, but whatever it's doing doesn't actually work in all situations. Just let us override this manually in the settings, please, otherwise we can't actually use the service."
Im veru sad about the payment method you should allow upi apps for payment also that everyone can pay and watch
Cant get it to open
Croppy Connection
Weird
"Worthless, totally useless app. Freezes constantly."
I will not support a company that has softcore child porn on it.
I'll never forgive you for cancelling The Dark Crystal Age of Resistance.
"Trying to login from two days. And it said on my first attempt ""too many attempts to login"" ??? What does that mean?"
I don't support pedophilic company's.
I cancelled my subscription as soon as I knew that Cuties was coming out I do not condone to child pronography
Most of the times the app doesn't open. Says try again later.

"What's the point in selecting spoken language? I select English and still 75% of the programming is a different language. I'm one bad day from getting rid of Netflix, pretty sure disney+ is going to steal netflix American market. When I have the TV on I'm working and doing other things so subs are worthless, and not being able to listen is annoying. End up never watching netflix anymore due to this. They've give up on the english speaking market. Pretty sure netflix hates English america"
They should make the world wide Netflix so one in one country doesnt have to evny the other persons content
"Been payng for this now for years and it used to be great nowe it will only get to the installed part then won't complete the download of the app itself! Iv got the space for it so don't know what the problem is, also it won't download back onto my smart TV even tho I had it on there for some time great when it's up and running but it's getting it there Â¡Â¡"
Garbage company that promotes the exploitation of children.
You need to have Wi-Fi with this ... That's a big seller right there and you don't have it ... That don't work for a whole lot of people...
Buh bye Netflix! Nobody likes child porn in their library. Hello Hulu!
Netfilx is so very good well
do not update Netflix or install new update just screws up all older devices. you will end up getting error code -1001 and Netflix customer support has absolutely no idea how to fix it. they will give you a bunch of bogus IT fixes like tell you to restart you devices and if that doesn't work they have you restart your router. obviously neither of these work because it's a problem with the app and nothing else. obvious fake IT support solutions dont work they will say you need to contact ISP.
"Promotes immorality, depravity and pedophilia."
Have to log in every time I close the application. Error 12012 again and again.

Very kaachra Bad Irrelevant
"Irrelevant suggestions, bunch of series for below 100 IQ viewers, algorithm which doesn't base on any of what viewers really watch, plus charging Ultra HD for non HD contents so it ends up paying only ""Extra"", nothing Ultra about it. Plus, I never watched Indian movies before so do not suggest any of it. â€¢ Browse new titles or search for your favourites - WHICH ONE? GHOST? GREASE? ITS UR FAVOURITE MOVIES FR GRANDMOM ERA â€¢ The more you watch, the better Netflix gets at recommending - FALSE CLAIM"
"App works great, however the child porn pretty much sums up the people that run Netflix. Unsubscribed!"
It fails to sign in don't get it it's a waste of time
"So many bugs, 1) app doesn't save which episode I'm on or where in that episode, 2) the forward button causes the app to freeze if I press if too often. 3) app shutdown out of nowhere when I'm trying to change shows"
"Broken on Android 7.1.1 since latest update. I've been trying to login for days and the only message I'm getting is"" Sorry couldn't reach Netflix services at the moment. Please try again later (-9)"". Could you fix it? Thank you"
Worst in class app interface ....may be Netflix had a great content but they don't even show promos for free in app interface ....start from payment ....but let me see and browse all content names only at first .... So that I can choose which ever is best ...that's why no video streaming app is up to the mark in Indian Market .... They are just money greedy ....like Netflix ... I don't choose any content just because it's trailers on YouTube or so called Negative or 18+/Rough language .....!!!
Cannot connect to chromecast properly and issues with video Player.
This app does not work on my tablet..and the worst part is that it does not let me watch using a browser... Not expected from netflix
I expect less pedophilia from a movie platform. Don't support this dumpster fire unless you enjoy 11 year olds twerking...
Only the subtitles visible. Video not playing. Fix the bug
"I don't know why they don't accept some cards, it is quite disappointing... Facing lots of issues as a Netflix user. Even after complaints they are not considering the issue. Disappointed."
Not workings
When my free trail is up and is time to update my payment i typed in my info again and there is still a problem and i have the necessary money on my account to pay for the programm
"Please fix this I'm trying to login my uncle's account, it said it's wrong I even asked my uncle what's the password and he said the exact password, please fix this!"

Child exploitation? Really? Netflix should be ashamed of themselves. .
App barely works. I shouldn't have to Uninstall then install it again just for it to work for a couple days

Big time battery drain when casting to Chromecast
Worst app ever

Disgusting
"I can't access my account . I tried a lot of time it's show check ur password , I entered password and then it's shows wrong one . What d hell is going on"
This is not very good app
"What dumb app. I recently started using Netflix on mobile. The worst part is, the application just frozes whenever I try to skip a scene or move ahead in the series I am watching. It only shows ""Error playing video. Try again (5.8)"". Cannot you fix this issue. I don't use live wallpapers and I cannot keep restarting my phone all the time when this error pops up. This type of problem didn't occur even while using Hacked Netflix"
Every time I try to skip 10 secs it feeezes and I have to close the app to replay where I'm from and even then it doesn't work at times :(
1001 error and not starting
Every time I try to sign in it just send me to a free trial won't let me log in to my account.
"I'm not using nonceflix while they think its ok to sexuallize children. How is this app still going Google, when you took down LBRY for way less?"
The app doesn't work for whenever I renew my subscription after a period of 3-4 months...it had happened every time.i had to uninstall and reinstall to make it working
Disgusting company who supports the normalization of pedophilia
"After seeing ""cuties"" I no longer carry netflix. It was mainly for my children, but they now watch Kartoon Channel which is free and I dont have to worry about them seeing any inappropriate content and its actually educational. Netflix needs to have more parental controls or a whole diffrent app for kids."
What a terrible App for a payforview service it can't even follow a series in succession. I think they keep the app bad to hide the terrible film selection. Now looking for a better pay for view service not impressed
"HELP!!!!! The app just won't open anymore!! I'm paying for the service but I cannot watch anything, PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!"
"It says ""unable to reach server. Try again later"" whenever I install and try to run it"

"Still not working, getting an error that it can't reach the server. Please fix."
"Got it before ""Cuties"" came out on it and they apparently support pedophiles so I canceled my account but now it won't let me Uninstall the stupid thing"
It was fine but now every episode of every show buffers for the last five minutes updates are supposed to fix problems not cause new issues
It hasn't worked right in days on my tablet. I had to keep deleting the app and reinstalling it or it wouldn't stream. Now it won't work at all.
No free videos are available ðŸ™
Wasting of time and mony
Its not updating and i simply wasted my money lol i feel bad that this happened
"Not working. Asks for login, then goes to the home screen of tablet. 2nd day today."

Immediately after starting up the app (wasn't running in the background) it keeps stalling on playback, need to logout and log back in to eliminate the problem, occurs frequently. Similar situation encountered when casting to chromecast ultra, gets stuck at 98% or 99% loading, never plays. Unless logout out and log back in."

Worst app ever used...one star is also more than enough.. doesn't allow to take subscription even if you use the cards mentioned..and live chat is of no use they'll just make to wait unnecessarily and there is no respond from their side...really dissatisfied with this app
Crashes on my acer tablet
"Pedoflix, promotes pedophilia."
Its having an error again blah blah blah
I think it's time for people to move on to other parallel like Netflix because seem like the support don't care about the people opinion or feedback anymore. Netflix has made their millions. Many hollywood movies are not avaliable in my current region while they are avaliable in the other. This is like we don't have access to the library like other countries or regions have. How can you charge the same rates in all regions and don't provide the content we need ? Bad and disappointing.
"I can't watch the movies or shows I want to; it only has the sound on. That's it. I restarted my phone, uninstalled the app and installed it back, updated my system and Netflix, went into my accessibility to see about the color correction, etc. and I still gotten nowhere to the issue. I can't watch Netflix at all. Can someone please help me?"
I only have to say one word. Cuties
Evil shows. So much satanic videos. I cancelled. Stop watching there videos.
Supports pedophilia and its disgusting
"No experience at all, the app did not even open to log in. Pay the subscription for not being able to use the app , what a disgrace of the service."
Love you
Take off cuties
"kim namjoon, kim seokjin, min yoongi, jung hoseok, kim taehyung, jeon jungkook app is cool"
They support pedophilia.
It always freezes when I skip
I hate this app. I have to uninstall it multiple times to watch a show or one of my downloads. The errors are constant. Wth am I paying for when I can't even use the service!
"Unnecessary bloatware, I don't need it but can't uninstall it as it was pre-installed in my smartphone."
CUTIES!
Recharge problem
Its not free of cost
I get sound but no video! uninstalled nd reinstalled..same thing happens
Netflix is run by satanic pedophiles
Uninstalled because Netflix and cuities promotes pedophilia and supports child porn fodder
Cuties? Really?
Promotes oversexulisation of under age children and pedophilic people!
ngl. this app was fire until... CUTIES
Horrible experience using mobile app. 90% of the time app freezes at netflix logo page. Even for showing an error it takes few minutes. Seriously you expect us to restart our phone everytime we see a error???
You suckðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
I love movies
5.12 error code occurs and I can't use the app at all. Still hasn't been fixed after 3 months
Can't download it
×¢×¢×¢× ×¢×¢
Peddling soft core child porn. I hope this company goes under.
"Mobile app just sucks, i mean netflix is having its own problems after thinking cuties was ok to air lol but now the app cant seem to remember where you leave off and always jumps back like two or three episodes"
Fuknin shite this
"For basically advocating for child prostitution, human trafficking, pedophilia, and sheer lack of sympathy for parents across the world who have had to deal with scars and fears of their children being sexually abused. Here you are praising it with the show Cuties strait up F U."
This app doesn't let me watch any movies or anything anymore. I have the app paid for but it just doesn't work. And there is no problem with my phone
When I downloaded the app it was not opening it always tells me restart my device or relaunch app
Canceled subscription and Uninstalled. Will never use Netflix again.
"I have bought a plan for the app but unable to watch any video yet. Whatever movie, series I try to watch it just show loading on the screen... What is wrong with the application... Is it going to work ever or my money just got wasted?"
App not working on mobile not sure if other Androids or phones experiencing issue I have a Google Pixel 4. Not an old phone by any means. Otherwise like the app when it functions
Canceling cuties movie trash and partnership with the Obama 's is useless
Video is not displayed although the sound is working fine while viewing any content on the aap .
Teka nis na
I can't get in my netflix acount please help me what happend?
"Pedophilia is disgusting. I will not support company making content made for pedophiles. The ""Netflix original"" Cuties needs to F-ing go and the people who greenlit this should be placed on a sexual offender registry. Also Using religion to justify a bunch of 11 year old girls in hot pants doing stripper routine is also WRONG (Netflix auto response to negative reviews about the show). I'm giving netflix two billing Cycles to remove this trash or im gone for good."
This option is not Paytm and rupay card
Sing up problem very poor app
Cuties.
"No Serbian subtitles, useless..."
"Pedoflix, you people support pedophilia."
"Note fe indonesia after update netflix app, drm from L1 become L3. Contact netflix cs and they said ask samsung to make it L1 again? Other drm check, the phone still drm L1 only netflix app read as L3"
So basically I logged out and uninstalled the app because I did not want to use Netflix anymore and yet money got deducted just 2 mins after I logged out .
Why is out of sync? Im watching the chapter 4Â° and here in the app is playing the 2Â° chapter.
When I play the video only thing I can see is a green screen... Nothing else it was working before but I don't know what happened to your app
Ss essential for the delay. We will be in a couple of weeks ago by the time to do with my friends and relatives and the rest of the day of work TO DO NOT WANT
Netflix app should have a filter which lists shows according to the selected audio preference. The way the app is designed its kinda hard to find dubbed shows in one's own language. Hope to see improvements in this area.
Dis is so stupid lean 2 make something better
Always crashing
I cant sign in for free
Disgusting app from disgusting people ðŸ˜¡
Stupid app not remembering where I left off.
They should've name it Shitflix
Why is netflix preinstalled on my samsung phone and i have no right to uninstall you for good?
not working on android 11
Slow
Netflix is for pedophiles. I deleted my account because Netflix chooses to let a show air that allows little girls parade around in next to no clothes showing off their bodies for the world to see. Its sickening. Just a bunch of pedophiles.
"Video sucks on Mobile version, no matter you're using iPhone"
Didn't get movies what I want....
Stop suddenly
"Netflix was great at one time, but is an empty shell of itself now."
Kkkk
"It doesn't have the movies I want to watch like terminator, 21& 22 jump street, let's be cops and many others.. like what's the point of paying for it then."
"Since this update,i am unable to open the app on my android tv! My tv is pretty recent. What am I suppose to do,buy a new tv? It sucks. Please fix this. I might have to cancel my subscription if it is not fixed."
Amazon prime is way better than Netflix... first they haven't good contents and too expensive and can't share ur subscription...
Promotes content that sexualized kids
Glitches
"It's a good app but before I paid for it, the app run properly but after I paid, sometimes It shows some kind of ""error""... Even to open the app and to watch the movies..."
"Error in downloading,everytime after I download 3-4 episodes I have to reinstall the app again for downloading more episodesðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ¤¬"
Need some changes. Like getting ride of shows or movies that no one likes
Very expensive. Amazon prime Rs.999/year. Buy here 800/month
My app doesn't open y ?
"2 DAYS already I cannot go through, it says ""no service"" issue.. then I tried ""help center"" guess what IT'S NOT CONNECTING!!!!!! Fix it!"
"""CUTIES"" IS DISGUSTING. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!"
"It cant connext to the ""Netflix"" service"
"This company pretty much giggled at the fact they had a show ""cuties"" promoting pedophilia and did not take it down In respectable time. I will be cancelling subscription"
Chal hatt
Constantly freezes on my phone. So annoying.
When I open the app it brings me on the starting page..I amnot able to sign up my account..can you please tell me what shall I do ?????
Nasty playlist the Destroyer children's Minds
Me and my husband decided to cancel our subscription since you want to keep Cuties on your platform. It's disgusting that you would support this movie enough to show it and it's sad you won't listen to your customers. We'll *consider* subscribing again if you remove Cuties.
oh
It's not working
I can't use with this application in my phone. Would you help me please?

It's not working on my mobile since I have restore my mobile phone.
"I have spent nearly two hours trying to start Netflix, unfortunately, it does not allow prepaid billing. It frustrating how you always complicate things. It is not very friendly to people who does not have any kind of debit card. And I was really excited to finally be able to afford it, turns out, I can't! Lol, reality is jndeed often disappointing! Sigh..."

Wrost app... Sometime I download movie and series it disappears automatically and consume my all data. There is too much problem with update payment my plan was 199 and they change it into 799 by themselve without any information. When I was updating my plan they didn't give me any option to change my plan. Do not trust this app.
HATE IT 100000%

Sucks
Literally facilitating pedophilia

"I've just updated Netflix today and when I try to open it, it just kicks me back to my home screen"
When pedofllix changes its mind on exploiting kids as sex symbols they might get my patronage back.
Most of the content specially kids content .. has inappropriate scenes/ideas .. I highly recommend people not to use this sex channel
I hate it
Cuties is horrid. Cancelled service
Lately when I am watching a film/series it will freeze but audio keeps going ..... even when i try to close the app or put it 10s back .. still having the same problem ..
Sucks ass!
You have put a movie with children and have made pedophile a thing so this app is the worst... you had a chose to not post that moive and you did...*cutites...*
Crashes
It doesn't work
Deleted because of the lack of removing the disgusting movie cuties.

Pedophile content is being hosted on your platform.
Supporters of pedophilia. Do not use. Would give no stars if possible.
Would not download
"I used to really like Netflix and have maintained a subscription on one email address, or another for years. They got really political by pushing LGBTQ and ethnic issues hard. I watch shows to escape all the drama going on. I don't want to have my nose run through it here, too. Now, they even have a pedophile exhibitionism show called cuties and I don't think I can support this company any longer. I will not support a company that glorifies the sexualization of children. Hulu et al."
Version 4.16.6 that my old KitKat tablets recently received videos wont play unless i log out and log back in but i have to do that every time which is very inconvenient. Used to work just fine before that update. Yeah i know they are way old which is why i was surprised there was an update available for it.
App refuses to work properly video randomly stops while soundtrack keeps going
"I used to love this app, but netflix has assigned itself with the task of liberating the LGBT community. As an adult, I say do what you want, leave me out of it. Not interested. It ticks me off netflix is now putting LGBT agenda into shows for pre schoolers."
1 star only due to static release note.
Miserably small offering.
You guys are a bunch of sick and disgusting perverts for allowing a movie like cuties to not only be on your streaming service but also making it one of your original movies. You are sick and disgusting pedofiles and i will never use your service ever again!
I can't connect
Doesn't work at all. Error 5.10.
"New update sucks. It stops the time but it keeps on playing. And when you click back, it will not continue to what you were just watching."
Since Android 11 update I can't use the app
Disgusting pe*ophile app. They stream sexual movies of 11 year old girls but don't even have the newest updates on shows. Plus they don't have most good shows. TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY. Would not recommend. ðŸ‘Ž
(2017) Keep disconnecting the Chromecast which isn't a deal break but a huge annoyance over and over and over again. What is a deal breaker is that the app keep freezing.. 2020 and it's still happening...
What's happened? The most recent update is literally unusable and instantly crashes when I open it. Sometimes I can get as far as clicking Who's Watching but it's completely unusable.
Sometimes mobile version gets slower or hangs.
Lots of movies that I want to watch is not available on our country :<
Thard class application..cant accept my payment always...
"Pls. Change the Position of Lock Screen opt. with Play Speed I am From India instead of original and Full version and I am Getting censored/cut/Edited versions For Example Vikings TV Series I want Original version Also Brightness Issues, app don't allow system brightness and When I increase Application Brightness my Screen/video Got blur If I have set Other language for any particular movie and after Closing the app than Video I Resume video it Start in English instead my set language ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”"
I am unable to set language as English in Netflix App by default some arabian/urdu language is showing. In my phone all Apps are in English by default but I don't know why Netflix is showing in different languages.
The app does not open on my phone. I have a pixel 2xl. It gives me an error message saying Netflix cannot be reached. My internet is fine.
Your app is trash and so is the service anymore. Ill never subscribe to your garbage again
For mobile The sound place but the screaning doesn't and its really annoying seems like they haven't fixed it even if you restart the app or delet it this problem is still there
After recent update app keeps crashing
I was downloading this and when I was trying to sign in it didn't let me go in so don't download this.
Poor downloading
"Absolutely the worst app. Content doesn't load for TEN freaking minutes. Can't control playback speed. Absolute nightmare. Nothing loads. I keep waiting for the video to play, but it NEVER does. Update1:now its loading much better, but still 1 star because there is no option to control playback speed. Update 2: playback speed control has been added but the app has become very buggy now."
Always have the same error message and i already change my phone and its getting worse. You better fix it.

Not able to register on Netflix App
"Used to work now fails to connect. Was fine until recent update, that initially failed to login, now, after uninstalling and even factory reset of tablet, it just fails to connect to service. Netflix help was next to useless and just walked through their already useless online help. Then suggested I contact device manufacturer or blamed my network....works on multiple other devices, just not tablet. This sounds like impacting others so their app is the fault....not great."
"Why the one star review, you might ask. Two words. Cuties movie."
Hi the shows will be playing but the screen is blank like so blank i am not happy i have even paid my subscription
Baddd
Goodbye idiot aplication bye2
Not able to update the app. The update doesn't get downloaded. Please solve the issue.
I keep getting an error if I leave the app and try to resume my previous show's episode.
Don't approve pedo undertones on netflix. I might just cancel my subscription till its taken off my streaming service.
Can't connect with wireless headset. Actually some time it's connect some time not

"I have been trying to payment on Netflix for 4 months but my VISA debit card isn't working on NETFLIX ,so please Netflix bring the payment system by RUPAY debit card in india .. so I can enjoy the NETFLIX . my so many friends are facing same problem or you can bring PAYPAL payment system in India , but payment by RUPAY debit card is much better. Thank you so much and otherwise you are doing great . Good luck . Lots of love from INDIA."

Can't open the app
"I am having a lot of issues with the app I installed on my tablet and it worked great then the next day as I went to watch something it came up with an error code an now says its incompatible with my device, how can this be when it installed and played in the first place. Help anyone."
They're promoting pedophilia!
"Will not open. My email login is there I click on it program closes. Uninstalled then re download, same issue. Works on my s10 not on my tablet. Please help"
"Doesn't work on nexus 7 as of Sept 2020, says can't connect to service yet every other streaming app works fine..."
Always getting a error 5.10 with dolby vision titles
"Android TV subtitles on by default. Every single tittle had CC on by default. There isn't a global setting to turn it off. Every time i start a new play i need to stop to watch later, turn it off. If i stop and start again, I need to turn it off every single time. ****subtitles issue has been fixed**** On Android TV, closing the application requires way too many clicks. Pressing ""back"" eventually brings you to main menu, press back again and ""close app"" is not an option. Why?????"
"When I opened the app everything of mine was gone; user and password gone, can not choose who is watching and has all new info. Statement when trying to download app again ""beta storage on app is full"". What's that mean? How can I get back into Netflix without changing everything and being charged 2x each month"
Somebody needs to be going to jail for allowing children to be exploited.
Becauseif you use it so long you have to pay for it after so that's why I gave it to one store cuz I don't know why you guys do it but you should make it where Netflix is free everyone likes Netflix me and my parents both have it I've had it on since the first time I've actually had a phone which is two months ago so she's really fix that
Looks like it about to crash on my android phone
"Everytime I open this app, it say error 1001. My internet connection is OK and I tried install and uninstall and it happen again."
So upset cos I can't watch it on mirroring apps
I wanted to watch LATEST anime series here. What i got is old anime. I have already watch everything that NETFLIX HAS TO OFFER. what a waste of subscription. So lousy that this app cant even keep up with the new anime trends.
You put Cuties on your selection. Acting like it's gonna teach something that parents are not.
Having shitload of issues since last updates... episodes. Series start from end then crashes after 1sec. Sending me back to home screen.
I love Netflix but lately theres allot of glitches volumes on shows goes in and out whenever and a bunch of lags in everything u try watching it im switching to Amazon Prime or Philo not paying for something i cant even watch half the time such Bull****

Because of the 11 year old dancers in an 18+ rated show
La aplicaciÃ³n estÃ¡ muy mal en el sistema de reproducciÃ³n. AÃ±ade series que ya viste a tu lista de mirando actualmente. AdemÃ¡s que cuando adelantas por 10 segundos se traba. No sigue el capÃ­tulo en el que vas correctamente.

Zero out of 5 stars. It's a company run by perverts trying to push an agenda and corrupt people.
Ayla
Cant open on note10+ ....
Netflix is currently crashing upon opening the application.
It has started to promote peadophile now!
"The quality is less than even 360p when I've set the stream quality high. I do not understand how this is possible, does high quality mean 360p? Why am I paying 799 rupees for? For 360P quality streaming?"
Look you don't have to exploit-children to show that child exploitation is wrong. THAT IS LIKE TELLING PEOPLE MURDER IS WRONG BY COMMITING MURDER YOURSELF!!
Optimize this app and fix bugs
"Can't open app. Don't ask me to troubleshoot coz I already did everything. So no, fix it!"
"Netflix seems to support pedophilia,remove the child porn Cuties"
Dont keep apps that promote child porn and even has the balls to.protect it why you lost over billion in in revenue
Ø®Ø±Ø§Ø§Ø§ ÙŠ Ù…Ø®Ø§Ù†ÙŠØ«
"I selected a basic plan(199 Rs). Then, automatically they deducted for Hd plan (799 Rs). Is this a joke ??"

Ngentot banget rasanya seperti anda menjadi ironman

Promotes child porn.
"Any media entity promoting the sexual exploitation and grooming of young children should be put on trial for Crimes Against Children/Humanity. The creators of Cuties are extreme pedophiles. Pedophilia is NOT a mental disorder, and even at the slightest chance it was, it does NOT give you [Netflix] the right to condone this behavior. Wrong is WRONG! Enough is ENOUGH!!! #DefundNetflix"
Always stuck playing video that already downloaded.. Its not Internet connection problem as i can rate 1 star for you in play store.
Supports pedo content
Can't open the app after the update.
"Netflix is garbage, was preinstalled on my phone and I don't want it."
"After upgrading to Android 11, this app no longer works. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but I am greeted with the same error message whenever I try to open the app."
Too much costly

Screen issues since Sept' 20 update. Getting writing on download screen over lapping other writing.
Latest update causes the app to crash. Problems in resuming the currently watching videos.
Hahahahahahabahahaha
Suck app
I despise crappy update messages that have no information. You get voted down for such behaviour
"Promoting pedophilia and hating islam you sick fks cancelnetflix because of ""cuties"""
"When i start using this its fun and i enjoy watching.. but sadly when my phone got corrupted .. all my account is not functioning or lost..then i start again to install , from that i can no longer sign in or login to my Netflix account every time i tried.. its says error password error username.... im dissappointed because this account is monthly payment and it charges to my credit line... i hope i can log in or should i say i want to cancel my subscription.."
"When resumed, it turns to blackscreen"
Nice
app doesn't want to open
"This AAP is not working in my phone ,is very bad isssiue in this app."

Worst
Pedophilia content
Everytime it's telling error 1001 while opening the app please check the bug
"I love Netflix and the selection that it offers but recently I haven't been able to update my payment and it is getting really frustrating because it states I can't access the verification module for the OTP and even more so I can't view any selections. If you won't let me pay, at least let me watch. Why should the consumer suffer due to incompetent digital servers and operators. As a result, I have shifted to Amazon Prime and Hotstar Disney+. At least they don't have this problem."
I cant even sign in the app :(
Cuties. Nuff sed since Google keeps deleting my previous reviews. CancelledðŸ‘Ž

Cuties says it all
App is crashing everytime giving (-1001) error could not reach netflix this is rubbish i did a reinstallation but no luck pls fix the issue
Bad app management
"I have lost respect for you. You refuse to remove a movie that exploits children. I can in no way support that. You should be ashamed of yourself for putting this movie on here. People are cancelling their subscriptions with you. I don't blame them one bit. I'll be doing the same. Remove that movie. They are children, not sex objects!"
#savecaos
"It is so annoying to watch on mobile. It'll pause and stick on one screen, and when you'll go to a different show it'll say ""video not available"" then when you'll go back to your original show, it'll be stuck on a black screen."

"NETFLIX SUPPORTS PEDOPHILIA, THE DIRECTORS OF ""CUTIES"" AUDITIONED 650 PRETEEN GIRLS AND HAD THEM TWERK. WHY DOES ANYONE SUPPORT NETFLIX?"
The app isnt responding saying it has an error . No use even after uninstalling and reinstalling.
Plan improve krne ki jarurat h..
"Pedophilia, Nonceflix... utterly disgusting"
Time wasted
I want to unistall this app pleas help mi...ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
"Not able to use.... The app is HORRIBLE. Doesn't accept any of my card payments, why won't it keep paytm as a payment method it would be much easier.... They're getting the money anyways."
Says I need an update. Wouldn't install update. Uninstalled to reinstall and now don't have it at all. Very annoyed
Cuties.
Its too buggy
Good
"Ever since the latest update nothing loads, I cant watch more than 3 minutes of a show without the app freezing."
"TV app is buggy. While video buffering, loader stuck at 24 percent and sound keep coming in background. I reset my TV and pre install version started working perfectly but play store update the app then again same issue started"
"Remove Cuties. It is child pornography not feminism. You are bleeding subscribers because of 1 movie. Just remove it, problem solved."
Sexualizing children is not cool.
Can u pls fix the pause play option.. I am unable to resume the movie when paused
Charged me 19 dollars even though I got the standard membership So read this if you're sure you want to get netflix
It wont even open!
Wish i could give no stars.
Every time I would wanna watch a show it would show a black screen but I can hear the audio.
Cancelled. Cuties disgusted me
"The app started glitching out of nowhere, and even after I uninstalled and reinstalled it the problem wasn't solved. Now it simply shuts down without even letting me log in and I haven't been able to watch anything for an annoying amount of time. Don't know what this is but it f-ing sucks."
Stop taking off your good movies! Smh
"Won't work since last update. App was working great til then. I can't access anything. I keep getting error code -1001. I followed the Netflix solutions, but nothing works. Update: Now I get error code -9 can't connect to Netflix service. I downgraded my start rating from 2 to 1."
Can't reach Netflix service after new update.
"The app won't open. I just get errors all of the sudden...... I had to cancel. Besides, recent content is disturbing on a whole new level. ðŸ˜¡"
cancel cuties
Ew
Well I can't delete an account I can't watch
Trying to overdraft your bank account !
"I got Netflix for the original movies like Coraline but they removed a lot of the stop motion animations like Jack and the nightmare before Christmas, corpse bride and Coraline which are some of my favorite movies and I was sad to find out that they got removed."
"The app gives dozens of errors when trying to open it, it just keeps saying ""Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service"". I have to turn off wifi to successfully open the app. Then, once I get in the app, picture-in-picture no longer works!"
"For any one who has issues getting on netflix, just delete all your accounts from your phone in settings which it causes a bug to not letting you in. After you delete them all, go back to netflix and you should be back in. After you log in add your accounts back in your phone"
"The intire month movie would start then 5 to 10 min an stop ,saying"" we are having a defacult time play your selection! 3 wks dish net work says its a problem with your company i just know i pay 164 for crapy sat.

Do you have cars 3 because if you dont have it i will delete netflix
Because why the heck would cuties even be on here
Don't get netflix! They support children pedophilia!
Protect our children and ban Cuties from Netflix. 11 year olds have no place in the porn industry. Children have no place in the porn industry. Netflix should have no place in the porn industry.
Nice except the sexual content with minors aka porn
"No me deja ni abrir la aplicaciÃ³n, se queda cargando en ""netflix"" y nunca se abre. Ya la reinstale facil unas 15 veces, voy a cancelar mi subscripciÃ³n:/"
Jerome Vanderhoof been with you guys for awhile same stuff getting old and most of the new stinks
This is awful i rate this 0/0
Promotes pedophiles
After update the app keeps crashing
"Well, it was good until the company became overrun with pedophiles. Service cancelled and app removed."
"When i want to watch a movie, all i keep getting is a error code 12012."
#cancelnetflix imagine trying to normalize pedophiliaðŸ¤¡
"I'm getting increasingly frustrated when watching foreign films/shows subtitles randomly stop showing up. This happens probably 20-30 times in a programme. Please please, otherwise the app is great."
"The app was fine until the last update. I can't log in at all. It takes me to a pop up to pick an account that was auto saved with google, after I pick one it just kicks me off. I tried clicking none of the above but there is no way to get past this screen and type it in manually. Very frustrated."
It used to work fine but not sure if because of Android software update it keeps on showing an error.
The company is promoting the sexualization of 11 year old girls.
Cannot even log in to netflix error -1001 im canceling my subscription because i only watch on my phone
Netflix supports the sexualization of children. Will never subscribe again.
Bad
"app works but new content this year has been poor and is getting worse, if it doesn't improve by the end of the year I'm cancelling."
"Ever since latest update I can't even open the app, bout to cancel it if it's not fixed soon."
It's stopping
Disappointed that you broadcast the child porn.
The app is not opening

"Netflix is stable and all, but Cuties is absolutely disgusting. It's pedophilia and normalizing it. How is the company okay with it?"
A very bad network. They are spreading every unethical human trafficking. I have unsubscribed from their service.
I cancelled Netflix when they showed CUTIES . This is child exploitation. Shame on you Netflix.

I couldn't able to open this app i don't know what is the issue
Encourages pedophile
App is Good But I want Uninstall in my One Plus Nord it's preloaded app.
Should consider regional sensoeship... Disgusted with repulsive content forced down to our throat in the wrong genre.
"You've lost my sub, my guess is Netflix will know the reasons, no need to bring them up here!"
A good app except the fact it says error
Disney hotstar is better than Netflix netflix has old movies and hotstar has new movie every day
This is very expensive i can't bear it at all.
Hey. I cant login Netflix Aps via Smartphone. Wht????????
MANY SHOWS DISAPPEARED IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
"Doesn't even open. For weeks now every time I try to open the app there is an error, something about a server. From what I can gather this is a widespread issue and not just me. Very disappointing and I feel like it makes netflix not worth the money I pay when I can't even watch stuff on my phone."
Its skips around and then totally freezes the first 15 seconds into watching something. I back out and start again and it does it all over again. It does this 4 or 5 times then straightens out. It's really annoying. This is a different day and its 10 times worse than the day before.. I cant even watch my show at all now.

Bad
"Netflix app on Android is bad, main issue is video quality, SDR content looks really bad on my Note 20 Ultra, if I play on iPhone things looks way better, SDR issue I tested on Pixel 4 XL, OnePlus 8 Pro, Oppo Find X2 Pro, S20 Ultra and now on Note 20 Ultra. I thought it's my phone issue turned out Netflix on Android have real quality issue, I have tested Prime Video, Disney+ and they look awesome on Note 20 Ultra. I am keep changing phones for Netflix but now it's up to Netflix to fix it."

App acting abnormal after the recent update. Videos always start loading in SD and take significantly longer to get to HD. Im on 200MBPS plan. Video gets stuck when minimized. Can't resume after pause. Pinch to zoom is also broken. Wassup NF! Fix this guys!!
I didn't give this app 1 star 'cause it's a bad app. I don't even know if this is a good app or not. I don't use Netflix on my phone and I'd like to uninstall it from my Samsung but it doesn't let me. Anyone knows how to? Both Settings and AppStore doesn't allow me to uninstall. Well... I did click uninstall in AppStore but the app is still here. Anyone can help me? Thank you.
I am having -9error problem what way to resolve
can't subscribe using telcom
"since the newest update I can't watch it while I'm doing other apps, they don't update on the latest episode when im watching a series.. please fix this.. did not have any complains before the newest update."
Bad worse worst
The app doesn't work
What does this mean? Beta program for this app is full. I cant log in. I cant even open the app. Whats the problem? I paid for this.
I can't open an account.
"I started using Netflix back in 1997, had thousands of movies delivered to the house. Then they started streaming and I paid for that for several years. However over the last couple of years, this service has become bland and boring... too much political mess and extreme views put into shows its just over the top. But this cuties mess... Seriously what in the..."
No changelog
Good
Wast of your time with bad ideas.
1 star because Netflix CA t keep up to what episode I'm watching. Everytime I open Netflix and continue one of my tv series it always shows me the episode I've just watched from the beginning instead of taking me to the next episode. I've raised this with Netflix support but they refuse to address it. 1 star for the poor support and not fixing a known glitch. I'm not the only one commenting this is happening to them
"Many people have unsubscribed for a reason, and you go and cancel things like Dark Crystal when we wanted you to GET RID OF THE LITERAL CP FILM CALLED CUTIES. YOU ARE ENDORSING CHILD EXPLOITATION EVERY MINUTE THAT FILM IS UP. We will not stop until you either get rid of the film or end up dissolving because you think that film's message is soooo more important than your financial lifeline. Maybe after banning that film from your service you can then do productive things like improving the app."
Best app

"i can't watch anything anymore. whenever i try to watch something it either won't load at all or it says that there is a problem playing the video. i did all the steps it told me to do to fix it, but it won't work."
Getting buggier and buggier everyday

Too expensive
I dont like that you have to pay.

Whenever I open the it always it's always unreachable
"Since the latest update, I can't watch Netflix on my phone, I get an error message telling me my network connection is bad or something like that. I was Netflix primary on my phone....I will cancel it if I can't use it and I've belonged to Netflix since the company started with DVDs!!! Please fix."
Netflix Pedophiles so avoid
Picture in picture isn't working
Netflix showing error -1001 could not reach the servers

Evil paedophile supporting scum. Should be no stars but they don't have that option.
uselee app
Cuties
Please reintroduce rs 350 per month plan.
So much for watching a movie tonight. I got an update message but won't update just sits their and spins. Nothing nota zilch I might just go ahead and cancel my Netflix subscription.
Doesn't work on Android 11
Yeah I'm having problem to use Netflix nowadays. I'm facing the problem from 5 to 6 days. I've tried to get a correct answer from Netflix India but they're avoiding me like it was nothing. And my problem is that I'm unable to see the page where the card gets verified. They are showing me that we're unable to load this page please try to contact your bank which I did but they told me that if they had issue with my card and its information or with Netflix they wouldn't send any OTP to verify.
Am yet to use .
New update is not working well its giving error when update the payment and open again this application. Its not updating the payment kindly check or review this application its not working. Netflix.
"Had to upgrade the app, now it crashes before I even sign in. It won't open at all, whether I try to log in as me or just log out. I have rebooted and reinstalled more than once. Now giving up on this app."
"Does not support Android 11. App crashes with error code -1001 before even a log in prompt. The classic rebooting advice, nor disabling any vpn's does not fix this. App's fundamentally broken if you're on Android 11."
You pay for it and it buffers and you'll start watching a show and then it'll turn off. With all the other apps you can watch it on different devices at the same time but with y'all you can only watch it one or you have to pay for it thinking about maybe going to something different that allows you in on more devices at the exact same time that I don't have to pay
Not a bad
This app peddles pedophilia and should not be used by anyone. Deserves zero stars and a prison sentence for everyone still working for this garbage company.
Payment mode is not supported to rupay debit card pls help us how to subscribe still no reply why not rupay
Disgusted with Netflix!!!! Shame on you for showing su ch dirty filth using little girls. Why would you fall for this when it just sets these children up for sex trafficking â—â—â—ðŸ˜¢ I hope parents figure this out soon and cancel their accounts ðŸ˜ 
There are too many problems with Netflix and I can't write them down now ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
"Since the update, I have not been able to open the app. Keeps asking me to choose Netflix account which I use with Google smart look. I chose my account and then just shuts down. So bad. And I'm paying for it, without being able to use"
Don't support pedophilia
This app doesn't remember anymore the exact point of my last video watch.
Dead
I cant even login to my account before that only the app shuts down
"I will not support Netflix as long as it continues to air Child Porn ""Cuties"". This is unconscionable & inexcusable!"
The app whod not let me log in to my account ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  i whant to f***** ing kill the app
One word: Cuties
Every time I open this app I have to update like what
Bad company
"Such a disgusting company. As someone who's daughter's were molested I see Netflix as an absolutely evil company that supports the abuse of children. I truly believe some should be in jail. I also believe you cannot be a good person and support Netflix, you are complicit in pedophilia if you do so. Every story of abuse you see you will know that you contributed to the pain that child feels. They are the worst of what the world offers."
"I don't want to be a part of a company that promotes Cuties, which is a movie that promotes 11-14 year old girls being promiscuous with older men and Im canceling our subscription"
Netflix pushes child p0rn and enables peclophiles with movies such as Cuties.
It won't let me sign in of nun as soon as the Gmail's that were saved on if come on and weither I choose one of the Gmail's or not it exists out and I've deleted downloaded it back and still the same thing
Tried 3 times to open to sign in but will not checked about space enough even deleted some old apps nothing ðŸ˜¢
It sucks
Runned by pedophiles
"Was initially great, but now very little quality movies are added, just a bunch of old movies and shows and more foreign ones than English ones."
I'm tired of seeing scary movies that doesn't have the ability to be in english im not gonna use subtitles I wanna watch a movie not read it also only one star because they are actually thinking about putting that series on with underage girls dancing like strippers wearing clothes way to revealing also they have they don't have the movies I want to watch they have the same old shows or shows that been out for a while please get some new stuff
"More unstable with every update.Very slow to load in Chromecast. And now, you hide the /title?? Is it so hard to check if a chromecast is online?? It is still a pain to have the cast icon available. Is it so hard to add a fast forward in chromecast? The years go by, and still nothing.. Now the connection with the chromecast is constantly lost. And the volume cannot be adjusted using the phone hard keys. And you will never fix respecting my audio language of choice?"
makes my device hang
Stop removing the good things
"Only be giving one star due to the movies and shows, other than that the false information advertised has turned me away ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ Quick to take money and defend itself.. Absolute BS. If it wasn't for the general public this app would be in the dumps, so how about some honesty!!"
"If i could give u zero stars i would, pedophiles"
They have no good moves and no good tv shows its a scam hulu has more
pedophillia and indoctrination
Y'all a bunch of PEDOS
It sucks I have to keep uninstalling and installing this app
I start watching a show and a few minutes in the movie stops rewinds goes back to the begining and starts
It's stupid because I am like a kid and I can't buy it okay I cannot buy Netflix for my phone so like make it to where people can use it that aren't young of age
The app is poor. Audio work but have a black screen very poor.
"The backlight control that overrides my phones backlight is horrible and makes no sense to exist. Especially, seeing that it doesn't go anywhere near as bright as my phone originally would. People use the app away from home, typically in the sunlight... Where brightness is needed."
Imagine having to pay to watch movies smh
"This app is so trash now it literally doesn't let me sign in it keeps crashing I've downloaded and deleted sevral times and also reset my phone, I have had this problem for 2 months and they will not fix this issue if this is not fixed I will be cancelling my payment."
Bad update
I will not put any more money into netflix for supporting pedophiles#saveourchildrens
"I can't renew my subscription, have tried like 10-15 times, reinstalled the app many times and entered all the correct details ... nothing has worked so far Please check what's wrong, i don't want to miss my fav tv series"
No March of the oni from lego ninjago
Pedos
"I wanted to give cuties the benefit of the doubt, but it's utterly indefensible. Anyone who defends that movie is a pedophile or people who sympathize with Epstein. This movie was shot in such disgusting manner. You don't comment on child exploitation while exploiting children!! This is softcore pedophilia, take my word for it. I want anyone who promotes this movie to be in a list and under constant monitoring by the child protective agencies. Do not normalize or condone pesos!"
This company supports child abuse and endangerment.
"my screen wont stop going black and it never fixes when i re open the app, there is literally no way to fix it unless i uninstall the app ive done this 7 times and it still goes black fix this please u pieces of shð—‚t."
"I can't support this company anymore. Before i was a parent i could definitely see the merit in exposing young girls pressure in today's media. However, as a new parent, there is a responsibility between how much good you're doing compared to harm. Cuties just perpetuates the problems it's trying to expose. It's terrible. Also, canceling dark crystal, putting more and more lame out of date bad movies as well as pushing tons of biased documentaries; I'll stick with the other streaming services."
"NETFLIX PEDOPHILES BURN IN HELL I'LL NEVER USE YOUR SERVICES AGAIN, NOW WONT EVEN LET ME DELETE THE APP, YOU GUYS HATE JESUS SO MUCH AND YOU WILL MEET HIM ON JUDGEMENT DAY WHEN YOU DIE."
The Netflix app got me logout and each time i try to login back on my phone it says my email/password is incorrect. Suprise all information are correct.
Seems like there's a problem with the app as I cant access it from time to time. Please fix this.
It doesn't work
Unable to minimize the screen anymore.
"Grainy video on phone, fire stick and Chromecast, checked settings and tried multiple networks and accounts. I watched an entire episode of Love Death Robots pixelated. I checked my network and it's a steady 50. Both YouTube and Prime Video got to 1080p in seconds."
Trying to install on my phone. Locks up at 77% every time. Terrible app!
"4 star to 1 star for promoting that pedophillic film ""*u****"". BOYCOTT NETFLIX"
What i believe is netflix must be ban
"The Expanse, 3% and Altered Carbon. All lost, ended or cancelled... [edit] OMG, they cancelled The Dark Crystal, you b******s."
Remove Cuties.
Pedophiles
It doesn't open
Worst content....the content published is biased and tries to tarnish the image of a particular religion - Hindus.
Bloatware that is uninstallable
Go ahead and download it if you are up for supporting a company that supports child pornography and Cho Mos.
Can't open the app
Support team ..pls look into the app. Netflix is down !!
Not so good
"i drop one star because Netflix keep removing the anime, i only pay Netflix because my favorite anime are here"

They love the kids.
Now even Netflix has started to censor scenes from the movies and shows! The only good thing about the service is no longer there now. Sad. Not subscribing next month. Ever.

How do I Remove Netflix from my phone?
Only volume control goes off when clicked on screen. The play and forward buttons still remain.

Supports and endorses pedophilia

One star for your views on child pornography.

The main villain of social dilemma is netflix itself
I am canceling my Netflix because I will not support pedophiles. The cutie movie did it for me. Not including you signing million dollar deals to people that are trying to hurt are country . Like the Obamas and the royals want to make a documentary on the BLM leaders. Are you kidding me. You will never get a other dime from me. And I am on a mission to get as many people to cancel theirs as I can. Good bye netflex.
I took the Netflix subscription for one month and I already paid and for next month amount is credited from my credit card without informing me very bad
"When I open my account it doesn't load anything. It just notify me the same thing over and over again ""Can't connect to Netflix"". I have strong and stable WiFi. Please Fix this! I'm wasting my money for nothing!"

I love Netflix
Ever since the update the app has been unstable. Sometimes the frames freeze while audio continues and I have to close it to fix. Another problem is that it //will not at all// keep track of where I left off or what episodes I was watching in a series. Nothing fixes it. I'm frequently closing the app and having to hunt things down every time. It's really frustrating. It never did this before. I know it's not my phone bc other streaming services work great. Please fix ):
Not working on my Samsung M30S
Very bad app ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
Very bad.. not able to open the app. Tried thousand times.
I wish that netflix can make the app free so all people can afford to watch for free
Such a Shameless application which promotes childrens towards adultery.
Have a 2 screen limit tells me I hit my limit with one not paying for an app I cant watch that and the child porn officially lost my business do not use this app

Woodchipper go brrrrr.
Don't have any new movies or TV shows they all are super far behind
supports Islamophobia and pedophiles...
Good
"I am canceling because of ""Cuties"". Gratuitous, explicit sexualization of minors. These children were in fact abused and violated for profit, under the guise of depicting the damage done to them by society. Fodder for pedophilia. Shame on Netflix. I'm voting with my dollars. Goodbye."
The most interesting app ever
Was a great streaming company until they defended pedophilia...
Ok
Really dissappointed because i was one of them whom are excited to use netflix and to admit piracy. As a middle class indian we only have an average of 1.5 gb per day. to watch just one episode in hd will cost around 700 or more mb. Then how can we call it binge watching if the site is eating all your internet.
Unable to pay due to it need postpaid no.. im using prepaid.. cant even pay via google play here.. dont have cards..
"Pls add payment via UPI app, my both ATM cards are not supported"
Can't find pokemon journey ðŸ¤¯
Cancel cuties... Get the child pornography off of your site... You are despicable... As long as there is child pornography on your site I will never watch a movie on it again...
I deleted netflix cause of cuties. Take child porn off of Netflix.
trash
it is stopping in middle while watching
When will Season 6 and 7 of the 100 will come out on Netflix in Malaysia I've been waiting for it to come out can u guys pls faster reaalise it.. Thanks
Netflix collaborating with marxist blm .blm & anarchists antifa staging unprecedented violence and hatred to America while purposely excluding destruction of multi millionaires & billionaires personal property.
Will not open. Wants an account with a google smart lock but doesn't accept mine. Not so smart.
i like netflix you can watch anything you want
I'll start saying nice things but right after you put back on digimon fusion for people in washington I already know about your how unfair your being to the rest of washington by keeping all the good kid tv shows in places in the world people who don't and won't even watch em so not cool
"I got error -9 whatever I do, I did multiple factory reset, tried other time, other versions of the apk... Nothing. My tablet is still perfectly functional except for Netflix. I tried the legacy version from their website, audio is cracking and unbearable. Support told me to wait and hope, they really didn't t care about troubleshooting their buggy app."
"See i use 2 love Netflix but then they want 2 take off the good n best movies of all time n now look at it,its all boring n stupid movies n I just wish they put new good exciting movies on Netflix so I am about 2 uninstall this app"
I think you know why I'm leaving a negative comment.
I dont like this were is the season 2 of nanatsu no taizai

Pedophiles. Anyone who honor such behavior are trash just like these devil. Pay a black women off to be the fool for their pedophilia. What a bunch of trash people hope you all catch coronavirus and die by the hands of an evil doctor. Trash
"The new brightness interface setting on the left side of the screen is terrible . I'm watching my whole movie with dim lighting. I tried raising the level of brightness and it was still dimly lit. If I want to increase the brightness of the movie from my phone settings, I'm unable to because the app puts a lock on the brightness function this is frustrating please fix."
"I've installed this app several times in my phone, but it doesn't work.... However on my other devices, it's working properly. I've communicated to Netflix representative but issue not resolved. Every time I opened error app, it says, ""cabt reach Netflix services, error code (-9)."
It has recently started sending me notifications despite notifications being turned off in the settings.
Promoting pedophilia? No coming back from this. Canceling immediately.
Horrible company that allows perverse video of children. Deleted!
Pedophiles run this app!!!!
Bring back Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.
Worst company imaginable. They are pedophiles who care nothing about your children. I will never give them another dime!!!!
Can't connect your Netflix on my phone. Fix it thank you

"Cause of it accepting ""Cuties"" in your platform, I'm rating it a 1 star review. You should've checked it out to see if it's safe, knowing there are children dancing very subjectively. I expected better from Netflix."
app is crushing can't login

Refuses to condemn pedophilia. No excuse and no comprising for hosting videos taking advantage of children.
"It's not working...i try to reinstall so many times....restart my tablet,delete the Netflix, try to install again and nothing..."
app will not open on my chromebook
"The app works fine, but I can't in good conscience support it, as the ceo of Netflix is implicit in a very disgusting thing. They produced and allowed a movie to be put on their platform, that is basically child pornography. This is disgusting and until it is taken down, and the producers are brought to justice, I will not be using the app."
Please give us more seasons and shows I am begging you please
Never use it
Very bad

"Done with Netflix. Every show has or changes a character to be gay (would be fine at times as media companies are pushing that, but litterally EVERY SHOW), not to mention the blatant allowance of pedophilia. Even gotta double check every little kids shows for my girls as many are not appropriate. So were done, moving on."
you know this app is not working in my country even with vpn... :(
There was no Seaon 2 or 3 of Attack on Titan had to buy them on DvD for â‚¬30. So in conclusion would not buy unless they get Season 2 and 3 of Attack on Titan.

I have seen it many times that when i close netflix while I'm watching a series or something and when i try to watch it again after sometime it starts from somewhere else and not from where i left. I'm facing this issue from last 1 month before that it was fine. Please do something its really annoying.
Netflix can eat s*** and die for making cuties! What the f*** were they thinking? Disgusting. Way to ruin a great service.
There is an glitch while watching sometimes and the screen gets blurry and audio breaks it had happened multiple times now
"Use to love Netflix. I canceled it due to material I do not agree with. Until Netflix can clean up the content that involves children, I will not be a customer."
Very baaad
So nice
Cuties child exploitation movie have cancelled membership due to the sick selection of films disgusting

Netflix doesn't update its movies series on time and it's very bad When the time and date of the show has been exhausted the show still isn't on Netflix but it's on other Apps
Since about two updates ago the app doesnt go past the start up screen with the Netflix logo. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn't fix anything.
Bekar
"I downloaded the app just now nd it not opening it saying netflix network cant be reach,with 4g network why.ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ "

Why I can't sign in??? This apps sucks!
It's not free
"I'm not able to open the app. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it for 3 times, still nothing. Please help me."
I cancelled your subscription because your series are hinduphobic. A hindu woman sleeping with a muslim guy in Dolly kitty. This is not one example. I ask you one question. Is there any other web series available on your platform which shows muslim married women sleeping with a hindu or a Christian guy. Hope to get reply soon..
Not free monthly rs 799 abo
It keeps on showing Netflix service cannot be reached. -1001
Netflix service is not good some time i can't see any video because of Netflix signal problem try make your signal connectivity stranger (-1023) error

This new update of Netflix is so so frustrating.....If you don't have enough patience plz don't download this appðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ 
sexual app
DC super hero girlsðŸšºðŸšºðŸšºðŸšºðŸšºðŸšº
Cancelling my account. This company is trash. Sundance films co founder is a pedo so before you say it's art it's not it's trash.
Video is very choppy after the latest update. Using an Xperia 1 running Android 10
Theres an error on your f**cking payment method youre trying to use!
Anti Hindu series on Netflix funded by islamic countries
Keeps writing can't load try again later...please work on it
Why my app is not opening ... it says... couldn't reach netflix service..... whyyyyy ????
"I cannot use it, wth?"
It's very poor and you can't even enter the app anymore this is a waste of time and money ya'll need to do something about this really fast r else ya'll are gonna loose customers and that's bad for business
The service has become too active in politics.
Fu*k you Netflix
Worst app Ever
I will give one star bc I can't sign in to watch anythingðŸ™„
"The screen to the shows keeps dimming SUPER low.. can't even watch the show. I'm legally blind so it's frustrating I can't even see the screen. It only does that in the app. When I close the app my screen goes back to normal, is there a setting I'm not aware of that can fix this issue?"
I cant open the app lol
ðŸ‘Œ
"It used to work. But now, everytime I start watching something it crashes. I'll get maybe a minute in, and it will just infinitely load. I'll probably uninstall for good, as this has been a recurring issue for some time now."
Netflix is not bookmarking the episodes I watched. It keeps me returning to the previous watched episodes. It is like I am using a free streaming app online where I have to remember where I left off. The only problem is with Netflix I am paying for it.
Such a waste of time
Noob
I loved nexflix until they decided to support the movie cuties. This movie promotes child sexuality and encourages pedophilia. I have been a member of Nexflix from the beginning and I have always loved what they were doing. Now they make me sick and I will never support them again.
make it free
"Disgusted by the certain programs Netflix has allowed on there, I am not supporting anyone who is fine with shows that glorifies women being abused or children joining a twerking dance club. The show Cuties is just going to make pedophiles very happy and that is straight up disgusting, y'all should be ashamed of yourselves! I'd give no star if I could."
worst web shows Totally hinduphobic and anti hindu
Delete cuties
Why I can't sign in
This is bad
"I liked Netflix until i saw Cuties,"
Cuties!!!
"0/10 very glitchy, do not recommend"
"Not letting me uninstall. A little suspicious, considering the loss of 9million subs. Use to be a great service before they started getting caught up into ""social issues"" and pornographic material featuring individuals of a particular age group."
Uninstall because of cuties YOU ARE DISGUSTING AND VILE AND PURE EVIL
Terrible i do not want to download an app to watch netflux when my rablet gas internet. I should just be allowed to wantch via internet
I DO NOT WANT NONCEFLIX ON MY PHONE & thank the Gods I can get rid of it from my phone!!!
I don't like when they post one episodes weeks later I like binge watching on weekends.
Yall put that trash cutties on so bye
Unauthorised activate your network implemented on 07.Sep.2020
"Like the app but getting ready to cancel by the the terrible choices of movies you admit fir viewers to see like ""Cuties"" horrible film! It's really child abuse!!! Obviously no respect for your viewer or children."
"Great app until they decided to support and endorse pedophilia by showing actual child pornography. Until they delete ""cuties"" (a show about 11 year olds trading sexual favors to old men and rated for adults) consider me, and millions of others, done with with our accounts. Will change to 5 stars and continue paying only if ""cuties"" is removed."
It won't let me download ;-;
Pedophile content will NEVER be ok. Long prison terms for anyone who promotes it.
The movie cuties is a disgusting movie please remove it is extremely inappropriate and disgusting and Do not ever sexualize minors like this.
Cuties? Really? Not big on child pedophilia.
Waste
Your video library choices are not at all good. I pay for entertainment not exploitation.
it has recently been getting errors and I have to install and re install every time I need to open it.
Contains child porn
Anti hindu activity in this channel Boycott this channel jai hind
Keeps freezing and some episodes never load. I am watching a show that has several seasons and episodes per season. I have missed several in between due to it freezing or never loading. There's also times I got to the app and nothing shows up on the screen and sometimes I get the accounts page but no titles will show at all it just acts like it's trying to load. Please fix or it's just a waste of money to have this service.
#SaveOurChildren
"Liberal agenda, child exploitation Cancelled due to Obamas and other liberals providing content, and the movie Cuties."
This app supports child pedophiles cuties is sexualizing children #save our children #wwg1wga #trump2020
Cuties
After seeing cuties I am second guessing this platform.
I cant find monster high
"People are fighting for our children and yet you release and defend a movie that promotes child prostitution.. absolutely disgusting! 'Cuties' needs to be removed as it never should have been released, yet never even should have been made to begin with."
bad experience every thing is old most of movies not available
They promote cuties
Im a 10 yr old that LOVES watching stranger things but i cant most of the time bc of school and i go to my dads on the weekends and now i cant use netflix on my computer without paying. >:(((
Hieua
Netflix is a vile corporation. Obvious their ranks are filled with lucifarians.
I cannot log in my subcripted account. Waste of money.
ðŸ¤®
Uhm. I WAS WOW
Take cuties off of Netflix
PEDOFLIX. Creating lefitist radicals and pedofiles as we speak!
I am not using Netflix as it seems they are becoming political and supporting the far left rather than choosing shows purely for entertainment.
I dont support the release of the CP film Cuties and have canceled my membership of 6 years. Will not be returning. Disgusting.
"Ew, cuties"
"Latest version, just get ""Sorry we could not reach the netflix service (-9)"". No solution works."
Gross
not into child porn you pervs i already canceled me and my fam
"The service itself is great, but the app is atrocious! despite changing all my playback settings and download settings it's not getting better than a mere 400 pixels despite a good internet connection. There should be an override setting for the app just like on the browser. All of the help foroums are absolute trash, and the app constantly crashes or simply wont play vidoes sometimes."
Most of time show error 1023. Poor app
Poor selection and they remove every movie that I'm going to watch
I can't access the app. It seems that my phone was banned from accessing it. Can't even proceed to the log in window. Already did the basic troubleshooting but still unable to access it. Please help me fix this!
Where is the settings and i cant download any thing because of that
Pedoflix
It was great but you know what you did
Disgusting content ! Delete and apologise for cuties film now
Doesn't work
Can't support netflix anymore due to my own beliefs that contradict theirs. Sad to say goodbye to the shows and movies that I use to watch over and over again.
Why not free
Let down all There's shows get us hyped and they can barely get a second seasons on the most anticipated TV shows like cursed and a good tv show should last 3-5 seasons
NO longer the same Netflix....
#Cancel Netflix
Pedophiles
Delete cuties!!!!
"They still haven't removed a piece of media featuring child exploitation. They cancel good shows, and feature terrible movies often. Get a different monthly streaming service."
Won't open up anymore on my phone Worked in the past but now asked to pick my account then signs off.
Excellent Wonderful Surprising Delightful Nice Sweet
Grooming the population to make pedophilia acceptable. SAVE THE CHILDREN!
They have no new movies and it's like I'm spending money for anything I want new movies I want to be able to suggest movies I don't like Netflix

worst indian show like dolly kitty aur wo chamkte sitare..promoting hatered toward a community...
"#Netflix We get only 30 min lunch time, out of which many of us serve the initial 5 min to customer than manage to eat and come back in 25 min, i guess bankers are also human like u guys, who need food to survive, but seems like this admin is either not a human being or doesn't consider bankers as human beings... On daily basis bankers are dieng by serving people like u in this pendamic, really pathetic to see no body puts a post about it... Netflix delete this post and say sorry for the same."
Netflix not workint at all in my nexus 6 ..
Child porn
You must apologise for hurting the feelings of bankers who are fighting to give uninterrupted services even in this pandemic
They promote kiddy porn (ie: Cuties) they don't belong on MY phone
It does not function well. I have to reinstall the app over and over again.
"Bad UX , wishlist , movies and series are categorised very wrong and bad. They make so much millions every day at least pay to make the user experience better for the audience."
ttitufu funetfðŸ˜ˆÄ±ix
There is so many movie /tv shows
I can't watch Netflix while using another app. Before an update there was a small window pop up so you can browse through other apps also. But now it's not there.
Cant open it.
Poor. Being charged for an international account in addition to my current subscription. I tried to cancel it and cancel my card used for payment over and over and I am still being charged for the international account for the past two years!
Always crush. So annoying
"I have been using Netflix for the past 1and half years and still they haven't fix the error (2.119).i have downloaded so many tv shows and movies, because of that error can't play anything that i have downloaded.waste of money for this app.really frustrated and need to fix this.ðŸ‘ŽðŸ˜¡"
"Why it netflix not downloading onto my device.? And when I somehow get it, it doesn't work because of a 1000 smth era.. what's the problem"
Netflix promotes the sexualization of children
too many bugs
Cuties!!!! Bunch of PEDOPHILES running Netflix now? Wrong on SO many levels!!!!
Have on fire stick.
"When I am watching a series and if i pause,then go back I am at first episode always. Resume to where I left is not at all working."
"Whenever I try to open Netflix app in my Samsung M30S, I see this error 'sorry we could not reach netflix service (-1023)'. I couldn't found solution for this anywhere. I also sent email to Netflix but no reply from them. Somebody please help me to solve this issue."
It has autochanger my language in Chinese may be and I am unable to move ahead because of the language bareer
Cartoons for kids promoting transgenderism? Shows depicting young girls acting in a sexual manner? I will not support any platform the places our children in danger from pedophiles or the mental health damages of making it okay to confuse a child as to what gender they are. This is all satanic.
Absolute trash.
"TV App: The most predatory app user experience you can find. Does not respect ""Back to exit"". If you open the app by mistake, you HAVE to select a profile before even getting the option to exit it. Autoplays the titles before you can even finish reading the description and autoplay everywhere it is a horrifying app experience."
Sufiyan 133
I am not able to login... When i select an accout to open the screen of netflix it automatically shut and no further display..what can i do
You should have provision for payment denominated in all currency and process shouldnâ€™t be limited to only credit card
"Dissapointed on apps security, why did changing the plans is so open and no pin/security ask first like others? What if kids wrong clicked and change the plan like random????? U should ask for pin if changing the plan!!!"
"My Netflix is not work so can someone please fix it, because I have been struggling for almost TWO Months now, and still none of the people got through to fix it. So I have been waiting and still the ""Netflix "" people did not do anything so I am giving those PEOPLE my angerðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  and to also say they are doing a bad job to help there fellow customers. Those people must be fired and replaced with reliable people to trust them to do there work properly. And I am 18 years old!!!"
Really don't want to see kids sexualized. Please remove Cuties.
Can't subscribe due to nonsense rules of recurring payment. Millions of people have money in wallets like paytm or rupay card account but they are unable to subscribe due to these rules. Such a shame !
So many web series r hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus. Stop this nonsense otherwise we will boycott Netflic and also take legal action
0/0 If I Could. Cuties.
The app won't play on my phone. It says the beta programming is full.
one star for removing some good shows !!
Netflix is now Gatarflix #dollykitty
Wrost app
Very bad app
"I can't even log into my account, since I used to use a friend's account before I got mine I have two options of logging in but when I click any of the two options it immediately closes the app and even if I try the ""none of the above button"" it still closes the app"
Some times going stop everything all netflix app stuck. Internet is working but netflix stuck please fix this bug...ASAP I will give you 5 star if you fix this .

Having issue with loging in and the lag when you're skipping the movie
"Shame films , anomalies,"
All was fine and dandy until the release of CUTIES. Talk about sick and perverted content! STOP SUPPORTING AND ENGAGING IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY! Way to lose your customers!
I love Netflix but since a while I have observed that the Continue Watching section doesn't seem to get updated to next episode and still show the older episodes which I complete. Please fix it.
Pano mag gawa ng acc
It's no mystery as to why I'm doing this and why everyone else should
The words go slomo in the middle of what I'm whaching
"The app won't open for a few days now, it keeps showing the same error 1023."
1 star due to Cuties. I hope the executives who decided to display this trash end up in prison where they belong.
Not downloading
Cuties is child porn

"There's a major problem with the interface. My Phone Language set to English and My Netflix Language (for shows/movies title, some of the interface and more) set to Hebrew, my native language. It seems like the app don't know what to decide, if everything should be in english or hebrew, or just some in hebrew and some in english. That's never heppend before, it cames with one of the last update. Before, and that what I think should be, all the interface was in the language you set for netflix"
i cant login please fix it
Each and every month while making payment app fails to respond properly. It will keep on showing verify your card and even after proper verfn it wil fail.

Kiddie porn channel...I dropped my 20 year plus subscription to this streaming service due to the fact it now allows it...
"For more than 4 months, I still can't open this app. I am having the same error that could reach the Netflix service and I don't know why."
Awful app

Less new content last 3 months
Cancelled the rs. 800/- per month membership as a protest against streaming contents like 'The Cuties'
"Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later. This is the first I'm gonna try this app. Unfortunately to me, this app is worst than worse. Don't install guys"
"Unable to view video, black screen with audio and subtitle, via 2nd screen with HDMI using desktop mode. Able to view video on 2nd screen with HDMI but no subtitle displaying. Totally no issues with youtube at all."
Deducted money without any reminder. I was not interested in taking subscription this month
Very dirty minded series are there
Bad
Why paying 11$ to watch films instead of getting it CD or watching it on the best two sites 1- egybest 2- gomovies And both of them dont waste as much internet as a film on netflix so... its not worthy ur storage.

sucks. Takes off the best movies and shows ever I'm done paying for garbage.
So after. After almost 2 years of being a loyal subscriber to the app. I can't believe they have poor service in dealing with customers. They have a research team for a simple notification bell icon but it's been a month since my last report on the problem with regards to notification bells not working and until now still no definite answer on my query. How come a top app like this be unreliable with updates and specifications of the use on the app. I am saddened by this and annoyed that i can't
I can here the movie but can't see them.
Buk
What's with me having to re log in what is wron
Not talking about app but how can anyone even use the app when one cannot do the payment. I want to pay but the OTP dialogue box turns into just a white box/blank box. Have been contacting Netflix regarding this for more than a month. keep updating this app but it's of no use to me since I cannot pay. Netflix said they are aware of the issue which Indian costumers are facing. What nonsense. Netflix is not able to resolve such a simple payment issue.
I'm not able to login to my account. Whats happening with the app.
Never watched it
Ghatya app
I'dont like this app cau'se its so boring every time i watch he always say problem
Addictive content

This has been going on for weeks at the very least."
Several times that i cannot connect. I just upgraded my account and cannot connect both on my phone and my smart tv

Contains child porn. Proof: Cuties
Very bad
Only for rich
You have free joker movie
Very bad. It did auto debit without my consent
Why is soo many contracts to obey and sign it...im sick of this app u know all i just want is to watch movie not to sign all those annoying contracts rghhhh....

Stopped working after last update. Lame.
Leaving because of your stance with sexualizing children
Bruh pedophiles kinda cringe
Endorses cuties show and is disgusting
Somehow in my phone i can't open it. Error
"Account saving is terrible, DO NOT USE A NOTE 4, I try to get into the app, but now that I have a saved account on it I can't get back in, it just immediately closes the app."
Bye Netflix. Hope cuties was worth it
Your trash app wont accept my virtual card
Who in their right mind supports young under age girls dancing like strippers! Wrong on EVERY level. Will NOT support this!
Evil people run this company
Disgusting
"Mess in groups which choices of titles in comedy, horror, scifi and fantasy. Netflix fail to recognize that titles of movies should put in groups"
I bought a mobile only plan but video quality is not as 720p as specified.
"Worthless piece of s***. Buggy app, the entire QA team should be fired."
"Trash, wont ever use Netflix until Neflix president makes a open apology for supporting that pedophile garbage ""Cuties"" and anyone who supports it is a pedophile. Straight disgusting excuse for a human being."
Slow
"It suddenly won't connect using data, only with Wi-Fi. This is so frustrating because the connection is good either way. What an inconvenience when I do not have access to the Wi-Fi. Wish I could give it zero stars. The subscription is becoming useless by the day."
"Repetitive Constant Freezing, long time loyal member for years, this was updated in July, it was already freezing constantly for months then, problem is even worse now. This garbage is so bad I hate using netflix."
I really like netflix but it won't work on my phone. I have deleted all data and installed it three times and it still won't work I click on and it takes me back to my home screen ðŸ˜“
"Honestly awesome, but I give it 1 star because of Cuties"
"Good App, but nothing good to watch lately. A lot my favs have been removed and replaced with weird and uninteresting movies and shows. Canceled my subscription. I think it's time to move on."
"Quitaron Loving Anabelle y Carol, (unas pelÃ­culas muy buenas) si estuvieran las pelÃ­culas darÃ­a 5 estrellas"
I have use Netflix for awhile and never had a problem streaming from my phone until recently I can open the app but it will not play anything it glitches flashes and then plays the sounds or subtitles only then nothing. Yall broke it and need to fix it back or yall are going to loose business.
"UPDATE: SAY NO TO CUTIES! SAY NO TO NETFLIX! The app has good functionality, however the remote control function doesn't live up to YouTube ability. The lock screen control keeps disappearing as well"
"I have to redownlad everyday as it says something is stored in the wrong place. Also dont agree with some content like ""cuties"""
Right now I have been trying to download the app since yesterday and it still haven't down loaded to my phone yet.
New version uncasts on its own from google chrome. Its really annoying.
"This app is horrible. How the HELL can a human being, let alone a GROUP of them allow child pornography?? AND YOU REFUSE TO DELETE IT. You make me sick. They are 11. #savethechildren"
The app is npt working at all and unable to watch any movies on it due to shutting down of it. HORRIBLE I'M UNSUBSCRIBING FROM IT..

NETFLIX is promoting pedophilia and islamaphobia.
It was awful really and bully into islam and humanity over all with all the porn scene and the support of pedophily ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢ this is crazy and extremely bad and agressive

"Ok so it's good... just 1 MAJOR issue with using netflix.. My first and only language is English and I don't speak any other language and yet I still get movies in different languages and i don't want to read when I'm WATCHING not READING a movie.. this changes it will be 5stars instead of 1, 1 star because it's always done this and i hate it sorry ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸"
Don't give money to Netflix. They exploit children.
I can't believe how much lagged this new version is! I just can't watch anything. Please fix it asap cause I'm bored ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
A product of pedophile production. Civilized humankind would not support this establishment. #cancelNetflix.
Child porn distribution
Pornographic app
"The newer Netflix Originals are, the more ""woke"" they get. Absolutely disgusting."
Films keep stopping about 2 minutes into film and going back to home screen!! Not happening with any other app and I have been told thectech team will be in touch in 3-4 weeksðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬Netflix team promised they would be ba in touch within 21days and that was 53days ago! Problem not fixed put still taking payments!!
From nowhere . I lost all my downloads
Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙŠÙ‚Ø±ÙÙƒÙ…
Rubbish. Will not download.
"Horrible customer support. I reactivated my subscription last month, but couldn't sign into this app, even with a password reset. So I signed in via the Windows 10 app instead, this time with success. However, I was charged a 2nd time in one month, even though I've been the only user streaming on 1 device. Netflix refused to give a refund or even a credit because it was past 7 days from the billing date when I saw the mistake & brought it their attention. Done w/Netflix. Not worth the hassle."
I wasn't able to do anything
It's not sncing the last left time of an episode from web browser.
Update has locked me out the app. I cant even download the app anymore.
WTH!!! I was watching with no issues and a few hours later a whole bunch movies and series just disappeared. Including those in my list. Now there's nothing interesting enough for me to watch!
Doesn't want to play on my phone.
It has to entered India with a sole Intension to malign Hindus and to Malign Indian culture.

I am not happy with what's happening in the apps. I can't even log on to my account or even view movies.. as far as I know I am paying deligently. Please kindly fix this . Or tell me how can I cancel my subscription.
You guys keep taking all of the good shows off of Netflix. Friends. Now vampire diaries is going off. Now charmed. This was the one thing that made u better than other streamers. And I know I'm not alone when it comes to being very close to canceling my plan.
Take it down

It's all just show all I m not happy with your service even I m using ur services but my money goes in waste I just take subscription and just it wasn't going well I can't be able to use it
"I'm on a premium plan but the resolution is not crystal clear HD like it was before. Why is this? Got a good connection and a flagship phone but still, resolution seems low."
Protector is westing time
It's not working
Unable to play the video
Pedophiles
There is nothing which is free of costðŸ‘Ž.
Seriously very slow when it comes to downloads takes over 2 hours to download a single episode.
"The movie ""cuties"" is disgusting and needs to be taken off netflix rn"
Do not support this pedo trash site.
Absolutely appalled by the idea of them releasing child porn.
I loved it until Cuties
Bad
wont even launch
Not a 4k video
"THE MOVIE ""CUTIES"" IS CHILD EXPLOITATION AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. IT SHOULD HE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY AND THE MAKERS THROWN IN JAIL."
"I have to reset my password every time I try to logan in. I wrote down the new password, so I won't get it wrong but for some reason it's never right, the next time I try to sure it"
"Worst experience ever ,its crashing like boing 787, waste of money"
Never used can't evaluate
Sucks
I will no longer be supporting Netflix because I do not approve of a company that thinks pushing and normalizing pedophilia is okay.
Lay fi. It
Ø¨Ù…ØµØ§Ø±ÙŠ ðŸ˜’Ø¨ÙƒØ´Ø´
I can't even download it to my Galaxy s10

Past few days The app crassing and showing error message. Just fed up with the error also tried everything still no improvement.
First time use..and subscribe with 199 but its showing too many login attampt (-56) and try some next time. Bad experience
"Won't return as a customer till ""Cuties"" is removed and netflix admits they condone pedophilia."
Bekar
I do not support pedophilia. Remove this app entirely
Child exploitation
"Won't let me Delete from phone, Galaxy A51 bloatware :("
The worst thing ever got to this world
Waste
This app i try to watch on it when i press chose the acc i do but then it's just not leting me inðŸ™ pls Netflix slove this problem
8.99 not 12.99 if u change price i will uninstall or Cancel.
Take out cuties now.
Everything was great until netflix endorsed child porn. Even if the film gets deleted i will not be re downloading this app
"Netflix app is really upsetting me... start and stop a show is ridiculous. You stop a show n when u go back your on the right episode, season but wrong time point in the timeline.. or even worse wrong season.. this has been on going for months now and really getting under my skin. Please fix this netflix, im a loyal customer and netflix lover but this is driving me insane.."
Ga bisa beli di playstore
"The offering just keeps getting worse, at least in Finland. Signed in for the first time in about a year, tried to find something to watch, couldn't, signed out and deleted the app. I don't know why anyone would spend money on B movies from 2004 and crappy in-house production TV shows that no one wants to see."
"No picture when movies/TV shows are downloadwd, just the sound."
can you please put back the barbie movie their myfavorite
I just wanted to report it to you that one of the movies I was watching (Bruno and boots) was cut just removed from Netflix I kept searching but I couldn't find it
The show offerings are extremely boring.
In latest build when we fast forward the screen stuck and only sound plays in the background
"No way to set the default profile. I'm the only one using my tablet, yet I have to select my profile EVERY TIME. Navigation is awful. Series episodes don't always play the correct one. You'll be watching what you think is the next episode only to find out that it's an episode from the next season and it skipped a bunch of others. Rarely remembers the last episode you watched, so it will start back at a previous episode you already watched."
I'm facing problems of screen freezing
"Limited Movies and Series, and there's not even a resolution option not even worth to pay for."
"Something went seriously wrong that normal play, fast-forward and fast-backward are all not working good. Deleting cache and even reinstallation do not help."
"New update has screen rotation issue.. Screen goes dark.. No video, only audio.."
Whenever I am open this app some technical issue found ...very bad experience (-56)
I find countable Tamil movies and Tamil dubbed movies. So please don't get Netflix for Tamil movies and famous Hollywood movies. It's disappointing.
This app is the worst just ban it my father is getting addicted to it ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
Please put resolution option. I'm tired of watching series at 480 when there's HD. I'd rather wait for it to load. Thanks.
The app is trash. It crashes too many times.
I was using efficiently before but now it's not even opening in my device ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜• I don't even know whats wrong ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
Make English available on all content its the most spoken language in the world
From day before the videos or not playing properly like gliches and also after reinstalling now it says many attemps -56 error pls rectify soon...no problem with my internet speed I checked the speed and also prime videos run perfectly only Netflix app makes this trouble fix soon...... if this error is fixed then this will be the best app
Lately it keeps forgetting where I left off a movie.
Taking forever to download. My previous tablet was stolen. This newer model was covered my ins. Not too impressed wit it... Verizon.
no audio when using headphones or bluetooth speakers using android mobile device
It's been 4 5 months i can't view a single thing on my cell phone screen.. just green flickering screen
its a good app but you guys really need to stop putting up so many horrible movies up that nobody wants to watch. You guys deleted so many good animes just so you can get space for putting up series and movies nobody asked for. i am thinking about canceling my subscription if more good animes are getting taken out because the only reason i subscribed in the first place was for the animes.
Payment page is not opening.
Really bad and too expensive ............................ .. . . . . . . .
Is ferfet
It Al ight
Loading sucks btw
The sound on most of the movies is so low that it makes hearing the movie impossible. This really needs to be fixed.
Can't access Netflix on our family TV
The new update won't allow all my devices to play Netflix anymore...it gets stuck on the sign in screen then shuts off...don't care for this update at all.
Beacuse it keep messing up and no good tv shows saying that Netflix wasnt responding
Naic
PIP doesn't work on Android anymore :(
Something is going on with the app all the writing is overlapped and you can't read anything on the shows episodes. now in a normal basis the app is great but please fix this issue it's hard to understand each show because you can't read episodes explanations
It wud've been much better if netflix added UPI payment method.
Only dark content exist
"Just after the new update today, the 10 second forward function is not working well. Sometimes it does work. Amd some time it forwards 10 sec, the screen is frozed and audio moves ahead..."
Dont want to lock in
Since the update the app SUCKS!!! It plays for a few minutes then it freezes smh fix this pleas
The new update is getting stuck while fast forwarding
To long to update
"Samsung Galaxy Note 10. The brightness and lighting defaults to the lowest setting unless I go to ""picture-in-picture"" and reduce the screen to an inch in the corner. No change in settings rectifies this, but the auto-play defaults with the smaller screen. Once fixed, 5 stars"
"The last 2 days, the app keeps crashing, fix it. Thanks"
Cannot pay the mobile version
good app but why i cant see all movie that suppose on netflix...can you explaine??...
Hello Netflix ... Now a days .. you have too much glitch. Develop it and fixed it ..... Aree .... Please fix it
Skipping forward or backward the play button and the scene gets stucked.
"Since todays app update, I have been experiencing issue with forwarding and backwarding as video gets stuck and this is really very annoying. Kindly fix asap."
"Since I updated Netflix, I haven't been able to do anything. Cant even update my payment details. It keeps saying we are having issue, please try again later"
Can I watch DC TV series in Netflix
it wont load since yesterday :(
Been glitching lately stays at 25% loading and have to keep resetting. Is not keeping track of where I've left off starts shows and movies from the very beginning each time.
Kinda pointless cause most of Netflix catalogue isn't available in Australia.
The recent update was very annoying.Too much bug on it.Can't even watch properly.please fix it.
Frustrated to have to u install constantly to watch something on my tablet.
"Whenever I fast forward, the video freezes, the audio keeps running in the background!! When the timestamp of both the audio and video matches, it starts playing again!! Really pissed. I am having this problem since last update."
Normally it works great and quick but it asked to update the app this morning and now it won't load past the opening page that says netflix. It's had updates before and never had this issuse so I'm hopeful it will be fixed asap.
The new update won't let me stream onto my Chromecast
The new update makes it so the app freezes every few seconds and I have to restart the app and sometimes my entire phone for the app to work again
Overcharged constantly raising my bill from 10$ a month to 25$ thats just wrong. Who else agrees? This gets a 2 star
Recent updates are hell seriously most of the earlier usefull things has been taken out... I don't know why and wht they were thinking before doing that
The new rating system is just not good enough
"Recently updated, the app get crashes, automatically log-out after every 30 minutes, subscription period got reduced by 30 days automatically !!. Please resolve and give return my subscription period !"
Not too many good movies or television shows to watch
I like the app but when I try to watch something some times it dosent even let me or when I'm watching a part of it it automatically exited out
Can't play downloaded videos. This happens regularly
Has not functioned properly since most recent update. Can no longer use which pisses me off because I was trying to finish a show thats about to be removed ðŸ˜¡
oi hi ni xx on s jj boj kb
Recent update is very poor.
I can't download episodes offline something about dls.2 error. Tried every single tips online nothing worked. Pls make an action on this concern cause I saw old posts online with regards to same issue and that was years ago.
Thank
"It's okay but I think it needs more Disney and more movies, and they should stop getting rid of my favorite movies and putting them on Netflix USA witch I can't get to"
They should add more entertaining movies and shows
I wish I could get rid of this!!
After latest update everytime I skip forward or backward the screen freezes. Please fix this ASAP.
"I can't find alot of interesting movies on my app, please do something about it..... Movies like: From zero to i love you Love victor Eat with me How to win the checkers The lawyer Etc"
One punch man season 2
"The quality of the shows are great and everything but an extreme off putter is the fact that they literally cancel every good show, what's the point of starting to film great shows when you're going to cancel them after a season or two. It's quite dissapointing to be honest."
"Recent update has many UI broken aspects now. Transparent background, overlapping text, laggy. Ergh. Can you revert while you fix these?"
"Always stops while you watching, especially in the good parts Lol"
"It okay and all but I'm in Malaysia and i didn't have any so call postpaid such as maxis, digi, and celcom i olny have Umobile .so plz add Umobile .BTW if anyone who doesn't understand what I'm saying just ignore me"
"you lost your butts off paying for that crappy and other explicative words I'd like to say show... Cuties.... Lost what a couple billion out of that. Now you got the nerve to hike up prices, or talking about hiking up prices? Being cheap was how you became so popular. Hike the prices up again I'll go get Hulu or some other app. You were respectable and affordable at one time now you're trying to get more money. You're about to be like the ""South Sea Bubble"" you don't know it look it up."
"I used to like Netflix, but now, it's not good anymore. You're taking all of my favorite shows, and you're keeping Cuties!?"
After the android 11 update in my pixel 3a XL it's showing server can't be reached error
If you provide a option of rupay or upi ..then it will be very beneficial to pay money who are using bhim upi.... Im from India...
Not all new movies are available ðŸ˜’
Lots of good stuff is region locked.
"Used to enjoy this app but not anymore. If I can' t make payment, I cant watch movies or shows. Uninstalling is the only option."
Not bad
ðŸ˜
i want to have more funtion filter on mobile. filter with time release of fiml...
I dont know if its the update but Netflix is not working on my phone. It works just fine on my Y laptop and other devices but not my phone. Wth
The app was good at first then it crashes and i can't watch my favourite series. I suggest you guys fix it. I can't imagine riding the bus with my laptop on. Too heavy and risky.
Recently started getting this error while renewing my subscription. Anything trying to access any url throws up a error response....Apart from that the app is good
Edited: Video is hanging after skipping for +10sec. Errors while watching on Netflix has been resolved on my device. It's been 2 years before it get fixed. Thank you.
"Netflix is a great app and all, but whenever I try to open the Netflix app on phone it says ""Choose a Netflix account with a Google smart lock"" there is also an option says none of the above. Whatever option I choose it kicks me out of the app Then I try to open it again it repeats the same thing. Actually it doesn't even show me the login option or anything it just kicks me out of the app right away when I click at it and gives me the ""Choose a Netflix account with a Google smart lock"" whatever"
incomplete series and bad movie selection...
"Annoying when half the videos get an error when trying to load, all their suggested resolutions say its my phone which its not its brand new high quality phone and service. On top of that the ones you can get to load will end up looking like a complete green screen half the time. Funny how its my phone yet amazon and disney have never given me an issue"
It crashes a lot hulu is better. And hulu doesn't put underage kids in a twerk group
The app is good
With recent updates I can't even open the app
i have try so many time to choose my payment method and i choose postpaid BUT there some error and i cant use that.. can you fix it for me i have done so many time
You people are losing rights of most of my favourite shows like young sheldon and that 70's show and this is disgusting.
"Netflix gives an option to download their shows & movies so you can watch them later. Well I downloaded a series & 2 movies in the Netflix app when I was in San Diego, California, & as soon as I crossed the border to Tijuana, Mexico, it wasn't available for me to watch what I downloaded. What's the point of downloading something if you can't watch it later? Netflix does not tell you this when they want you to pay for their service. That's pathetic. I'll use Netflix until I find something better."
Recent update means that I have to uninstall then reinstall the app every time I want to watch or download something ðŸ˜•
"New update is not working as stable as the previous version on myy android 10 phone. While watching something, it suddenly shuts off on its on and takes you to home page of netflix. It was not like this before."
"I cannot update my payment and it shows 404 error!! I'm so done with this! It doesn't even have many payment options, they should fix this, other than this everything is good"
Why can't I download anything.......
OK
Thanks for this app. This was the first I have learned about this. I think it's a great idea to use.
I am sick of updates each week. Whhyy? It freezes up if I don't use the update. Is this necessary?
"Can you please at least give an option to turn off the stupid in-app brightness control? I accidentally touched it once and now the brightness is messed up for everything and I keep having to manually reset it every time I go into a video. I set brightness by my phone, I don't want an in-app brightness control overriding my phone's brightness control. Nobody needs or wants that stupid control, and half of everyone hates it. Beyond that, everything else works bug free."
"This app is great, except one problem,EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  when I open the app it does not work it says I have to Redownload the app and fix my network box.that is why I give this app 2 stars instead of 5.this app is so horribleðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢!!!"
More profiles. I cant say this enough i have a big family and i dont want my kids to have to share profiles!!!! (I have 8 kids)
I had to uninsralled 5 or 6 times cause it was not working
"I tried signing in, but it's telling me that my password is wrong..I checked the password and it was right, but it continued telling me that my password is wrong, I continued trying, then the next thing it changed to was that my password or Email is incorrect, I then tried it on my laptop and they said that they are having problems with their place, that I should again in a few minutes , I tried again but they are still telling me that my password is wrong. I haven't been able to use Netflix."
I don't find some of the shows in the same way...for example I watch a series on the internet call Babylon Berlin which is an original netflix.?and when I check the application I didn't find it...you are very good but you are very not updated....Murder in Paradise i just watch season 9 but you are just began season 8....
Mmm....think.
"NÃ£o consigo selecionar um e-mail, quando clico na opÃ§Ã£o o app fecha. Realmente espero que resolvam, estou com esse problema hÃ¡ um bom tempo."
This app is completely useless and stupid. They have bad section of shows or movies to watch. There is literally nothing for me to watch nowðŸ™„ðŸ˜’ .They also remove all the shows or tv shows which is very annoying. It would be great if they added some of classics like Scooby Doo or Tom and Jerry or added some better shows that you see on TV. Overall I think this app needs some better shows or movies to watch and to stop removing good shows and movies.
"Idk why you added this but since adding the brightness adjust on the screen every show/movie is way too dark too see. I usually have my brightness low so when i went into the app it was already dark, when i went to turn it up it said i couldnt. I close the app and turn my brightness to max just to return to my video and it be just as dark as before. It says netflix choses my brightness and i can only adjust it a bit in app. Why is the max so low? I dont understand how watching a dark show is ok"
I try to connect with my tv but only hear the sound..no picture!!!
This is the best app ever u can watxh so many shows im goibg crazy i love it
Me Gusta mucho porque hay muchas. Cosas
Does not stay connected
"Though the recent updates are kinda dim and obnoxious, i was satisfied. Now it has gone out of hand. My screen goes black whenever i try to play something. Doesn't matter if it's a movie or a tv show. I have tried several times to get past this. For some reason i believe it has something to do with the brightness adjustments. On top of all this, the app crashes everytime. Why even bother paying if all it does is crash, glitch and waste time."
Plz show new animation movie
"Facing an issue where in everytime I fast forward a playing video, it freezes the video but the audio continues. And if I pause and okay it back, the audio doesn't match the video. Please help"
Make an update for restricting some unknown devices.
1.Why i can't use a VPN?! 2.What you mean i can't download on all my device 3.The player is just awful.
â˜ºâ˜ºðŸ˜ðŸ˜ƒ
"In Korean dramas, when a song is played that time the English subtitles of that song is not showing. You should show English subtitles of that Korean song also."
"I will give it 5 stars if Bleach, HunterxHunter and Seven Deadly Sins has been updated with new episodes or season."
"The streaming quality is so bad on tab s7 +, blurry and no hdr , i subscribe for the premium service and my internet speed is 100mbps!! Please fix it ASAP"
The screen keeps freezing to which I end up always uninstalling-installing the app to see if the problem is on my phone. But it's always freezing. I cannot watch in peace because of this. Please do something about this.
"Recent updates have made the app crash very often. Several times when skipping forward or backward the play gets stuck and we have to close the app and start again. Several times the app crashes and gets the phone itself be stuck. I'm having a high end phone and a network speed of 100 MBPS, still all this happens and many times the video gets played at a lower quality. This is ridiculous."
Worst Update/ bug happen just now what the hell is going on ðŸ˜¡
The brightness is too low in this app why. Also subtitles by default. It's really irritating when ypu can't remove subtitles
Not all Naruto scenes ewww
"Out of the keeps giving me a error. Not able to open,works when it wants to. Phone app for netflix is not good after the update."
Barely functional on shield tablet.
Love to but it costs ðŸ¤”
Cant update app so unable to watch total rubbish
There are a lot of films that were gone!
For the money I'm paying I really would have thought they would have better movies but that's not the case
App works fine. I'm just getting sick of NFs political bias.
I just purchased latest Oppo Reno 4 pro and disappointed to see that netflix doesnt support HDR for this device however it is HDR 10 capable. Please whitelist this Oppo Reno 4 pro as soon as possible.
Nice
The video keeps playing after I leave the app. I can still hear it then there is overwriting of titles within the app. Was great before I updated it. This new update sucks ðŸ‘Ž
Sometimes just decides to stop working on my TV??
Region locking content we paid to watch is very rude especially when there was no way to tell it was region locked untill after paid and try to watch it
"I've started using it on my phone but everytime I opened the app it just said ""Can't reach Netflix service"" and its been going on for weeks now??? You really need to fix it please. Thank you. Update: I still cant use it :|"
"Used to work flawlessly, now crashes most of the time. Even the 'continue to watch' function didn't work properly. As for the content, menu is rather limited tho."
Nice
"Not enough movies,and you have to pay to watch end of most series after season 1 or 2."
"The ap is cool, works like it should. BUT Netflix has questionable content. They see nothing wrong with the sexual exploitation of children and claim it is freedom of speech and art... I wouldn't use them PERIOD. In fact i have removed the ap and cancelled my membership...."

Constantly freezing or stopping to load content. Havent been able to watch a full episode of anything without closing the app and re opening
This app is amazing because you can watch anything you want to watch but the only thing is that they don't have every movie in the world .I wish they didâ˜¹ï¸
Honestly I would say that the app is a rip off but it's kind of Worth it in a way
"When i go to payment screen its only show credit and debit card only, no internet banking. I dont have the card u listed in, what to do?."
Have to keep logging on or uninstall.......it's getting on my last nerveðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜¨
I have a problem with the app as the video has started to glitch for no reasons at all. I cannot watch anything at all
Well it used to be good untill they took all the good cartoons out and started promoting pedophilic movies like cuties no tom and jerry no futurama just little girls pretending to have sex and shaking there 11 year old fanny to a 50 year old man
Only error messages at startup since update
ðŸ²
Below normal
There is no video only audio when I play any title on the application. The phone I'm using is Huawei mate 10 pro with Android 10 emui 10
Movies are way too old. Not enough japanese anime titles Or up to date horror movies. Only once in awhile a good movie or anime hits netflix.
Not much Indonesia subtitle available
there is only certain things I can watch since I'm in edmonton
For not putting season 5 of Riverdale and I also can't watch family guy so can u please add that and I'll give this app a 5 star :D
My shows are all of a sudden unavailable to watch instantly on the phone app. Works on TV but not on app. Seriously?!
Can't get the app to open on my tablet after installing and reinstalling. I choose the email address and the program just closes. Very frustrating
"After the recent update i can't seem to be able to watch anything, it would take times just to load the front pic and when i try to watch something it would just stuck on loading. I've tried to check if it was my internet but other apps on my phone work just fine with my current internet, only Netflix seems to have trouble."
Screen became too dark to see
Not all movies showing up example like part 2 for a movie is showing and not part one ...whats up with that???
Cuties is a disgrace to humanity's moral compass
FIX THE MOBILE APP! YOU CANT UNPAUSE WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING...
"It keeps giving me problems, i have to re-download it to fix it not playing any movies or series, only the ones downloaded play and sometimes they don't play ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸... It just keeps loading and showing me a black screen"
I have no idea what happened but for the past 3 or 4 days I cannot watch anything. Nothing will load. It takes forever for the main page to load and when I click on a show it wont load at all. I have tried updating the app and also restarting my phone. This is very upsetting. I am about to cancel my subscription.
Im getting a black screen anytime i want to watch...
horrible can not see all the movies load on my laptop
After the new update if I try to skip a certain part of a video it freezes. Its so annoying
Improper Streaming . Just updated this app. Tried watching movies or seasons. The Streaming stops. What's the issue guys.
This app is good but haveing to paying for a profile is bad please remove it
Everytime I use my Netflix app on my phone and cant even get 2 minutes into a show and it just stops. You can still hear whatever going on but cant actually see what's going on and I have to exist out of it and go back into it.
I rated this because it does not have all the movie I want to watch.like naruto the last or boruto
It will let me watch like 7 movies and than it won't let me anymore So I give it a 2 star rating
"Slow performance rn idk why, fix it ðŸ™"
"This app worked great but recently kept saying ""we couldn't reach the Netflix service""???? I restart the phone but still nothing. Fix the issue"
debit card se kese use kre netflix ko
After recent update I haven't been able to sign back into my account and I'm entering the correct information
This app cant work in many android tv in my country (Indonesia)
Most of the anime I mean like almost the entire anime that exist on netflix do not have all the episodes and that sucks
I do not understand the need to play all the content on display even when you are reading the descriptions from the movies/shows.
Stupid new window pops up on android app after selecting a title which can't be turned off....no imdb ratings.....idiotic thumbs up / thumbs down rating system.
"09/2020: Navigation is awfull, no rating possible during watching,no list of last seen videos,no favourite lists. Can not clear list of ""continue watching..."" Or delete films that I don't like"
Stop supporting pedophile
Many fee
My registration process couldn't move forward Because this app doesn't accept my card details. Also payment method is quite out dated There should be alternatives like UPI GOOGLE PAY PAYTM etc etc these makes payments more easy and reliable
Nice standerd and the movies
"Why can't I sign up? We have three debit card, one is visa and the other two are ru pay. So Netflix accept only visa and other card so we try to sign up on sbi card we try it for 7-10 hours now but it always say error on the card or use a different card, we use a different card but it was ru pay and we obviously can't still sign up so, By the way we try to do the standard 650â‚¹ if that helps thx in advance CAN YOU GUYS HELP US OUT?"
Initially when i was using tha app whenever i have to check tha notification or send the message from the notification bar it used to get pause automatically and I liked that feature so much but now that feature does not work have to pause manually. And also it always goes back to the episode from where I have started watching for that day. It doesn't continue from where I have stopped watching. Please fix these two measure issues.
It's ok...movies are dated app seems to buffer a lot lately...also the programme doesn't auto play from where you stopped it pain in the hole it is...
Last couple updates it's not saving progress in shows. An update is supposed to make things better not worse.
I feel this app is a bit over priced and can include lower slab packages such as amazon prime for limited content
"The past month or so the mobile app doesn't save where you left off. It will take me back one or two episodes of the TV series I'm watching. Also, it sometimes doesn't remember if I'm half way through an episode. Please fix this!"
"For some reason the app takes me back several episodes from where I stopped watching, its pretty annoying. Also only streams below 720p despite having the premium plan and have a 20mbps connection."
Too expensive in Turkey according to Amazon Prime Video for-sure.....
Best wishes

"The app is good except for the fact that video doesnt play half the time, the audio always works but not video. How does a company as big as netflix have an app this disfuntional"
"Usually does fine but now I constantly have issues with it freezing up. Every 2 minutes. I clear the app, restart my phone and update and it just freezes so much it ruins the movie all together."
"The Netflix app used to be amazing at resuming a series right where I last paused it. Unfortunately, it is totally awful now. It's a real inconvenience to hit ""continue watching"" for a specific series when Netflix takes you 2-3 episodes back to stuff you have already seen. Y'all need to do better!"
"Netflixs works great, Then you pause it come back and your screen is dark. You have to uninstall the app and reinstall everytime. Getting a bit fed up with this now"
1s
Ok
Make it so I can move app to SD card on my phone.
Not user friendly.
"Came back to say that's a year since i wrote the below review and the app still breaks down on a regular basis. Great service but really really bad app. Prone to breaking all the time. Always has weird bugs. Caption options on the website are not applied in app, videos randomly go haywire, too many errors, and very little progress ever."
How do I set up another tv?
Alright
It was working well but suddenly since past few days the audio plays before the the video. it doesn't sync properly. It will be helpful if you fix this bug.
I really like Netflix and would rate 5 stars if they let you pay with paypal with out a credit card whats even the point of having paypal as a payment option if they you have to have a credit or debit card its pointless
Bkvas hai
I don't know what is happening since I subscribed and downloaded the app all I see when I try to login is -1001 error Netflix please fit it ooo
While i watch a move or TV series it glitches and freezes every 5 seconds. It getting very annoying fix it
it never accurately shows me where i left off. i'd finish an episode and have the same episode ready for a rewatch again. but i actually wanna watch the next episode its not that hard why doesnt work why am i paying money for this
Blur and greenish screen comes when I start a movie or series..sometimes i have to close the app and restart it...
Nice
I will never give Netflix 2 stars â­ it has to be thankful
I cant open the app and continue watching dont show up what episode am i in
Pricing is a concern of Netflix other wise app is good and also add option in show's trivia to see in which languages ee can watch that show and other such information regarding cast language and Short intro or abstract of the show.
Why do the app keep crashing??!! I can't log in to my account.. i'm missing my favorite shows ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
"Everything is fine but payment options are quite complicated as they accept only visa , MasterCard and American express card of only selected bank which I don't think everyone have they should add UPI and Rupay card also and they don't have any student plan."
Useless
"Is there a way to get that ""Are you still watching"" message that pops up every 3 episodes removed ?? It gets a bit annoying to have to keep selecting that. If I wasnt watching the show, I'd just click out of Netflix . Please fix that"
"App is great!...when it works. Rather disappointed that I purchased a new HP Chromebook with intent on using it for NETFLIX, even signed up with my own account to do so. In other words, I'm immensely disappointed to say that it worked upon download after immediately setting up laptop. Signed up on browser, logged in app on Chromebook, then next day it doesn't work anymore? Error msg reads ""Application failure: Need to restart application"" more or less followed by #s. For days now. Disappointed."
Why TF everytime I press the home button to reply to a message and go back to the app to resume where I left off it goes back like 2 episodes
I couldn't use smart communication billing
Dangote safi
"Si van a poner a Walter Mercado, pongan a Jaime Camil en Loco por Ti. No mamen. Por favor."
"WILL YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ARE YOU STILL WATCHING POPUP? IT'S SOOOO ANNOYING AND UNNECESSARY!!!!!!!!!!! ALSO PLEASE MOVE THE CAST BUTTON FROM THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER TO THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER. WHEN I AM CASTING AND WANT TO SWITCH AND CAST TO ANOTHER ROOM, THE ICON IS HIDDEN."
Recently had a problem where the show doesn't auto save where you left off. It would take me past 6 episodes where I'm at and I wouldn't had notice this if I didn't kept in mind the name of the titles for each episode. This happen to me while watching Scissor Seven and Shameless. Please fix this problem. (P.S. yes I've updated and it still happens)
"Sometimes it's refusing to play on ny phone and sometimes it works, us there anyway this is fixable? Thanks"
"Can't look at my own account Can't use the email that I setup, also can't use my password. And they also gave me what they wanted to. A email address that I can't get in! I call them about it, they can't help. They even change my payment date."
"For a couple of weeks, that an error (1023) appers on screen when i want to start a movie/or series and to be able to watch it, need to uninstall and install it again... very very upsetting. After all do i pay for what?!? Honestely thinking about moving to another providerðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤"
"What's going on with this app not working on my zone? Everytime I tried to open the app, a flag pops up showing my email account, as soon as I hit on it, the freaking app just closes the whole enchilada! .....and here I am, bored as hell, and paying for a service that it just doesn't work! Please fix this soon, many customers are very upset already, with all reason!"
I can't download anything because it said that I already download at another device but I haven't download any at another device. I tried to sign out from all devices but same thing happens. Hope u can resolve this faster
Good but not account login
Can't watch downloads must reinstall the app every time
"Since the app update on 23/09/2020 I can only watch via my phone. I have the app on both my android phone and android tablet and they both updated at the same time but now nothing will play on my tablet. I just keep getting the message 'this title is unavailable, please try something else'. Content plays without issue on my phone."
Netflix your Android and web interface are nightmare who in their right mind would make the interface to browse library in such a chaotic way here's a crazy idea give me one option to see a list of everything in your library I know it's crazy right on top of that the my list category needs a TV or movie filter so I can just see the TV shows that I've added to my list or the movies that I've added to my list dumbasses
recently the app started crashing. It crashes whenever I try to login. It has made it impossible to watch anything. It is working perfectly on my PC. The problem is just on the phone.
Terrable i am having issues resuming my webseries. It's just showing loading and nothing happening next.
", Kinder good it's just had no good programs"
Im unable to play any moviessss .
Add more horror movies
Every time this app sends me a notification it freezes my phone and i have to restart it. If someday it gets fixed send me a message and maybe I'll reinstall it. Meanwhile i will watch Netflix on my ps4.
New update just drain my battery
Only Audio subtitle is coming no picture is displaying on screen.
Can't open the app. Keeps on saying device failure.
Just updated tonight...and now it freezes and will not continue to play. Not my service im on wifi and never had issues before. I still stream on my other streaming apps. I love Netflix. Please fix this.
Meh.. The film selection is like the bargain bin at Wall Mart.
"Netflix I don't know what that latest update did, but it did not fix the problem! You need to fix the bug you have where whenever I try to skip a little bit ahead it freezes the screen while it plays the audio."
Killer battery drain now. What the heck is going on with this app?
"hi when I open my Netflix it's saying that it want to be upgraded, but when I try to upgrade it it's saying that it won't allow the installation."
Unable to login .
1023 error everytime i login . i have to reinstall the app to make it work gain.. its too annoying
The app requires constant updates. I'm currently having troubles with downloading. Episodes stop at 98% then they pause thereafter. A complete waste of my data.
1 costly 2 only 5% good content
"What is happening to Netflix app, it stops while i am watching and then does not open, i have to restart my phone everytime. Recently resume is not working. If Netflix will correct all these error i will increase my rating, because i don't hv issues with the content"
I would like to know what exactly is being updated. You give no explanation of what is being updated.
"Hey Netflix, the forward and backward clicks is having a glitch. When trying to forward or backward a video, the video gets stuck but the audio plays. It takes a minimum of 3-5 seconds for the video to play and to sync up with the audio playing in the background. Can you please quickly look into this?"
I couldn't open my app since last 2 weeks because of the error code that keeps on appearing everytime I want to open the app
"It always say my plan is not compatible in the older version of netflix. I just lower grade my account, and now i cannot watch anything."
"Its a great expirience to have netflix on my device unfortunate this fast day i cant connect my account, i cant watch movies so sad that i need to cancel my membership bec. It was not usefull anymore i cant watch movies and anime series that i loveðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢"

Show of fun
Very intresting
"So disappointed, half way through season 4 of a show with 7 seasons. Go in to continue watching and it's gone with no warning."
You made she-ra gay and that really made me mad and you ruined the show
For not having sonic underground
"It needs more episodes for Miraculous ladybug, Young and Hungry, Dragons race to the edge, Spirit riding free, Free rein, Sam and cat, and H2O: just add water all have not been updated yet.I was like Netflix but none of the shows I like to watch updated"
"The content provided in India is rather lacklustre. Very few classics or best known English films. We don't have anything worthwhile to watch. For example, English Patient is available in the US, but not in India. Frankly, other OTT platforms take their India market much more seriously."
I try to sighn in & it want let me have to change pass word
This is a great app but it is always gliching and never working it would always say cant wach pick something else and that will say the same thing so it is not that good but i will use it again if i fix it

Sucks watched every thing nothing new or funny
"If Bluetooth is use, then Netflix plays at max HD instead of 4K. As soon as I turn off the Bluetooth it plays 4K again. The issue does not exist with competitors."

"Netflix is good but what is throwing me off is the fact they have a film named cuties, this is what dirty old perverts like, its wrong how 12 year old girls in tight hotpants twirling and dance like a stripper... cuties should be banned"
"The app was working well, but from since yesterday whenever i open the app it redirects to my homescreen again."
It makes me delete and reinstall the app each time I want to use Netflix.
"After i sign out & then again signing in i lose all my downloads, So i when try to download new videos the app shows cannot download no space while i dont even have a single download visible. please Fix this."

No experience..i not see
Bank screen fix it please and its stopping
Keeps giving me a black screen
"Can't continue what I watched after I switched device. How come my own account profile doesn't have watched history. I can't even get the movie name loaded when using search bar to search my previously watched movie. Is this April fool joke?Please switch to nextjs, it will perform better, and let your employee work remotely and they will build the app better when they are happy."
Expensive for my country ((((
"I really love this app and all the films and movies so I really dont have much to say, I only say alot when the app is awful like the DSTV NOW app this is so much better. Edit : However I wish NCIS, prodigal son and other crime films but don't worry I still love this app. And it now has Arrow My problem is my new seasons arent showing and I cant watch them and I still dont see the shows I wanna see like NCIS."

Too many bugs. The forward button doesn't function properly. The audio doesn't sync with video
Baad
Screen freezes sometimes.
Recently I've been trying to open the app and it's nearly impossible. It crashes before it starts. And i have to try around 20 times to get it to open...
Although Netflix did add some good shows and the 'Choose your own adventure games' including Minecraft Story Mode they did take out some of my favourite shows and the Aus Netflix does not have Aus comedies including 'The Big Lez Show' and 'All Aussie Adventures'.
"Terrible, I love Netflix and I hate to diss it but the app is horrible. For starters, half of the titles you can't even watch as they say 'sorry can not view this title right now' and also when you try to download a movie it says 'could not download try again later'. Apart from these problems the app is fine, but if you could please try to fix these issues that would be wonderful. Thank you,"
"Thank you for fixing the annoying bugs. Now my ""continue watching"" list disappears"
Give us beta update
New interface poor design less information on glance. Go back to the way it was.

The app is ok and the selection of content is decent but you can't organize the content you add to your list and it can be annoying.

Disband cuties and I'll resub
Doesn't let me limit data usage any more
"Netflix is discriminating based on region to the right to content. As there are many movies that are available to US viewers but not to Indian viewers. Also, when I tried uninstalling the app, there is no option to remove it from my phone. I am using Samsung Galaxy A50s."
Whats that!!! When i am forwarding it get stocked every time and the action got first then iam listening those actions
"Yap gotta agree this has NYC shows n sm Intresting stuff to watch but this app stops very often I tried clearing data n cache but yet it's the same even though I reinstalled it , it's the same so I think they shud fix the problem asap for a better Experience ."

Alot of ads lot of time to sing in
"Haven't watched Netflix in a while. Recently decided to start again. Unfortunately it will be short lived because when playing shows I've been in the middle of, no matter what, it starts the episode from the beginning. Even if there was only 5 mins left I had to watch. It is infuriating."
Most recent update first logged me out and now I can't even open the app on Android 11. Please fix this
"Has many things you can watch from but unfortunately, it's slow on my chromebook when i enter then just shuts down for no reason! Please fix this glitch! Also should add more childhood shows or any in general because some of it isn't really interesting."
It take 100000000000 day to update
"When I try to sign in, a notification will pop up saying which account will you use and I use none of the above since my account weren't in the choices but the app suddenly close and when I try it again and use a different option, it suddenly closes again. Can you fix this or something?"

Problem while download
"Lately the service has been really shity, the screen just freezes while the adio is still on. It doesn't save the chapters I've already watched so when I press play it always goes to the same episode. And there are times where the control buttons disappear."
"Needs a better, more reliable selection! AND you need to tell us what the updates are/are fixing! Your users have the right to know what they're downloading BEFORE we download it! I mean, that's just openly disregarding who owns these devices. Fix the sound! And, app stopped working after last update on 16/9/2020"

You guys need to fix this app. No one wants to pay for something that isn't working properly. It feels like a waste of money.
Good app
This sucks ass in the UK

The payment through my debit card isn't working.
I love it more and more am addicted to it netflix is baeðŸ¤—ðŸ’¯ðŸ™âœŒ
new movie please
Can't open the app. Lol
"Recent updates have (1) broken the 10s skip forward/back - now always results in sound sync errors (2) 20% of time, get an error ""Please try again later"" (-1023), but the cure is simply to kill Netflix using Settings and restart it, so the issue is clearly with the app and not connectivity (as Netflix ""help"" would have you believe)."
"For several weeks I've received the ""Please log into Netflix again..."" alert for every new thing I've wanted to play on my tablet. I have to log out and log in to play anything. Since others have complained about this already I assumed it would be fixed by now. Super annoying! Been watching You Tube, instead."
"At this point in time, Netflix should have a larger movie selection Because there are far more uninteresting movies than there are really good worth watching movies! For example, DeadPool 1 &2, Aquaman, and so many more."
"I miss the days when my recommendations were customized for me and my interests, rather than muddled with foreign films in different languages that I have no interest in reading (or being distracted by unmatching lips) or LGBT shows, etc. Nothing against them, they're just not for me. I can't pay attention to subs to save my life. It's more difficult to navigate through all the extra stuff and find something I actually want to watch these days."
It bumps you back an episode or three everytime you jump back to the menu so your always wondering where you should be.
Having a hard time downloading.
"Since the new update. I turn my tablet off , when I turn it back on I get a log in error . Have to log out. And log back in . Everyday. This didn't happen before And is annoying"
This used to be a good app but now I have to restart my phone all the time just to get it to work for maybe an hour or two which is irritating. Please fix this problem.
No background play any more. Does not respect phones screen light configurations.
"Gotta fix the little ""error"" where we cant watch nothing"
I had an account and went to update my payment method and it kept saying that I wasn't putting in all the card information and that there was a problem processing my card with 3 different cards it also caused my bank account to go into the negative because it charged a decline fee 13 times and I only ran my card 2 times
I like Netflix. Using for couple years. But there is a problem on tv somethimes swithing self off on my both tv samsung and sony. Many ppl have this problem (google) and never was fix it !! So big company cant fix that its mad.
I liked this app. But...there's nothing to watch! I'm a Steven universe fan and I want to watch it but I can't because its not on Netflix and my t.v.s off right now. Until its on here its only 2 stars for me.
keeps telling me to log in while logged in
I have an older android tv and Netflix is not available on playstore there. Rest all the apps from the world is there. This is kind of irritating.
Every damn update and same damn problems!!!!
Sound does not come when i share screen on chrome cast while other sounds are shared
I can't update the new version on my phone.
"I wanted to see a Japanese anime I paid for it, it was on the web but after downloading the app I paid then when I searched for it ,it wasn't there this sucks"
I was reading some of the ratings and one caught my eye cuz the thing is happening to me as in I'm on my phone and then all of a sudden it says there's an error and it happens a lot but otherwise this is a great app
I dont know why theres an error 2.111
Why we have to pay for this app??
I don't know why but somehow I can't access it on my phone...need to uninstall then install again...
"Downloaded full series and movies after few days the app logged me out automatically, and my downloads were removed. I had allotted data for it instead of using said data to download other stuff. LOL"
Took off That 70s Show. I've watched that every single day that is like a routine for us. For the last like 5 years it's been on! Not cool. Might get rid of Netflix.
Since the recent update the app will not play anything on android stylo5. It was doing great before this last update.
You screwed it up again.. no window in window feature..
I love watching Netflix but this app is so hard to sign up
I liked it alot more before the update. Now I have to back completely out if netflix before I can check anything on my phone. And when the hell is heartlands new season coming on.

Great shows but in Asia there is a limited number of American shows that I truly want to watch.
"Every time I open Netflix it immediately comes up with an error. Then I shut it down, clear it and then re-open it it works fine. I deleted the app then readded it, logged in and it does the same thing. Very annoying."

"Please improve filter for kids account. At the moment, the home page shows recommendations of shows that I would not want my kids to be exposed to."
"I LUV IT! However... minus 1 star because it stops to ask if youre still watching every 2 episodes and i hate saying ""hey google...resume.."" every 2 episodes!!!! AND minus 1 more star because theres no option to hide titles that are halfpie dubbed in english or offensive to you(like gay sh**)!!!! AND minus 1 more star because it has so many shows that have been cancelled and even throws them in ya face like ""hey start watching this"" only to get up-to-date and find out it's cancelled!!!"
"Several problems with the app. Whenever I cast Netflix onto my TV using Chromecast, there are times where the control buttons disappear and I cannot change anything on it. I have to disconnect from chromecast and re-cast it to continue watching or control volume. Also I hate it when the video stops and the message ""are you still watching?"" Comes up. I understand the value of that feature however I wish there was an option in the setting to turn that feature off."
Slow going so far
I am really enjoying in this app.
Slow
I am not able to watch the videos blurry and colorfull image came and not a single minute i am able to watch it.....fix thissss @netflix

It keeps messing up when trying to fast forward a bit.
Great app but thinking about canceling my membership due to the abundance of Obama garbage and pedophile cuties show.
Often has issues. Sometimes plays only a black screen. Other times it won't play and hsow an error message.
"Since last app update, if I'm watching a series, and close it in between, it wont store the current point till which I watched. So, when I resume it later, it starts a few episodes back, instead of the latest watched episode. Happens every time."
Buggy on android tv. Very hard to close this app. Not user friendly.
"It's annoying playing previews when browsing. Can't hear myself think. Also dislike that it automatically skips end credits, and you don't get to hear the outro songs."

"I would give higher rating if Netflix did not have a movie like ""Cuties"" I ametflix thinking on canceling my Netflix account"
Sexy kattte
Tried using through Foxtel but 3 nights in a row picture stopped with errors message. Could not resume. Poor picture quality through Foxtel. No issue with Android/Chromecast. STAN is better. New Releases aren't new releases...Too many foreign films/series. Only recently went back to Netflix but not much had changed. Going to be short lived.
You have to keep uninstalling it and reinstalling on your phone after you look at so many movies everything looks dark in the movies
Good
Speak and voice doesn't match after receiving phone calls
"the app is pretty good itself. good shows, and much more, but there is numberous amounts of problems with it.when i watch a series or a movie, every single time it goes back TO THE BEGINNING!!! i have to go back and click where i was and this is everyday. and its always ""error"" or ""cant reach the netflix service"". im not cancelling but i think there should be something done about this, and ive seen multiple people with the same problem."
My downloads keep deleting u guys need to fix this i have chatted up ur service workers none can fix this please work on this its getting frustrating after downloading 20 episodes of a series and boom when its time to watch it its gone really frustrating please work on the bug

"I'd honestly give this two stars because it was good for only a period of time, then I couldn't even watch anything on it because there were problems and I had to delete and redownload the app a few times for it to work."
"the app itself is great, but the service has so little selection that id just go with hulu or prime. they're more interested in making new shows than creating any kind of impressive catalogue."
Don't have Spanish language
To much application issue. App not working many times.
Two Stars as I used Netflix back in the day when it was the only major player in the streaming service. However do to recent updates to Netflix such as Cuties I've decided to pull the plug on Netflix

"While playing the shows, video just stops but the audio keeps on playing. Not really happy with it. Its ruining the experience. App reinstalled. Cache cleared. Still the same. Please fix"
The experience may be good netflix has other problems like the limited series and movies u get on the app. Say for instance Im watching a old series that has all its seasons already it only gives u a limited season and really angers me
"I don't know what's happening but earlier when I tried to launch Netflix I got an error says ""Device failure occured.Please restart your device and try again (501.-109)."" I tried to relaunch,clear data and uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing changed. Still the same error. Please Netflix fix the problem asap!"
Problem ..app installed in my phone...then the app still waiting for wifi to update....the only app that do that
Facing severe issues while using the app. It keeps on getting stuck and causes my phone to hang repeatedly. Please correct this. This started happening in the latest Update only.
It's only saying that choose a smart lock that the account is save on it press none if the above and it's only taken me out of the app.
"Netflix was awesome, but I just wish they didn't abandon syfy and horror. HBO max is taking over that department."
"Why there is no other payment option like Net banking , or UPI payment. If I am not using such type of card , I can't able to use the app. Is it not unfair."
Why is there child porn
The video keeps going blank while the audio continues to play ... dont know what to do

"This app is great, my only problem with it is the fact that after I watch like an episode of a tv show, I would go onto the next episode but it wouldn't let me watch it. It gives me an error I try it multiple times over and over again but it doesnt seem to work. It so happens with movies, It let's me watch like 2 minutes of it then it give me an error notification it's so annoying!! I suggest you fix it or i will carry on telling people negative things about this app and trust me I dont want to"
Where are the high school musical movies cowards
I can't freaking sign in! What the freak happened?!
I made an account and i started my free trial and it wouldn't let me sign in on my phone.
I've been trying since yesterday but for some reason I cannot access the app . I click on it and it opens and closes on its own .

App is fine. Content is poor. Unless you like unnecessary 3eÃ— in 9/10 of the movies and shows.

"I don't know what is the issue with Netflix. Whenever i am trying play video frequently i am getting error meesage saying ""There is a problem playing video. Please try again (2:2)""."
"I need audio and subtitles in French and Italian. It doesn't make sense that Netflix only makes some options of language available to us. PRIME VIDEO, Amazon, has plenty more options of AUDIO and SUBTITLES. Just because we live in a certain country doesn't mean we should be restricted from having other options of AUDIO and SUBTITLES. Again, I know about the copyright regarding certain movies and tv shows. I get that THE OFFICE is not available in all countries. But Audios? Make them available!"
Awesome thank you
Good
Please add boost volume adjust menu for the true wireless bluetooth device because the sound very low cannot watch in airplane.
"Love netflix ,but app isnt working, as i touch login it closes the app & i have tried all possiblities,so please help"
I have a High speed internet connection even then the download speed is so slow.
The payment won't update. Idkw
It a good app but sometimes when I go on it the show/film only gives me audio for a couple of mins and then I get picture as well but sometimes it takes longer like 10 mins till I get pictures and audio. This can be quite annoying.
The app constantly displays subtitles even after I've turned them off 90 times. App constantly disconnects itself from Chromecast then you get stuck in an infinite loop of adding and disconnecting from tv. An none of this was an issue b4 the update. Hmmm wonder if some moron forgot to try out the update b4 launching it?
Bugs.. downloaded movies fail to play error 2.119
Every time I try to open the app it starts to give me error and I have to open it 3 to 6 time just to enter the app fix this crash or bug its annoying reinstalling doesn't fix it
Keeps lagging out but my wifi is fine
Must improve your payment methods
Free movie
"This is usually one of my favorite apps but them taking off shows and movies is ridiculous. I was in the middle of watching that 70 show and I was in season 7, near the end and they removed it September 7th with no warning whatsoever. I feel like if a show is in somebody's ""continue watching"" category, then Netflix should probably send you a freaking email or text just to let you know that they're getting rid of it. It's hard enough finding good shows on here without you guys taking them down."
Poorly built app and mediocre library
l cannot access Netflix again for the second time
Some issue with the 10 sec rewind and forward button. The video gets freezed. Observed this on mobile device. Not sure about Smart TV Kindly resolve else the app is superb
It won't let me sign in my dad forgot the password and he's in Germany so I can't get the password and on my Tv I hav3 b3en thing fo4 days and it won't connect to the hub
They are good with their movies but for the last few weeks they won't even let me in to my own account and they won't let me open my own app.
I installed and then removed bad experienced
"Pedophilia, this is real."
I like Netflix a lot it lets me watch movies TV shows but the main reason I got Netflix has to watch the show called Teen Wolf that used to have it but they removed it the one thing that bugs me if Netflix is reading this please add it back thank you

"why it won't resume at the right time,it always play at the start"
for some reason my download speed is very low now days
"Cutie, man...not cool! Not cool. One more, I cancel"
"It's a great app but l have one concern, why on its search it shows shows that are not age appropriate even when searching on a kids profile . The Netflix team should hunt for a way to block all in appropriate content from kids view even if it's protected by parental control"
Add the hunter x hunter series and naruto and cobra kai series because there is more episodes so add more >:(

"Everytime i watch episodes, netflix never keeps track of the ones i watched, i will complete a episode of a show, log out for the day, then when i return to continue watching, the episodes i have completed dissappear as if i had never watched, this problem needs fixing"
It always crashes when you are offline. You can't watch your downloaded videos.
"Now don't get me wrong. I like Netflix and use it a lot but whereas until recently I used the app a lot on my Google Nexus tablet, now the app must have been updated because now I can't get past the initial login screen. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the the app. No joy. What a pity."
"netflix is good. the app, however, is not. If you want constant buffering and having to refresh 5 times for things to load, this is the app for you"
Love you
i love it
You got rid of season 1 on fairy tail how dare you
It is a nice app but I can't uninstall it
"Am seeing red right now because of Netflix. This updated version is really frustrating me. I have downloaded one series upto four times now, because each time when I go back to check my download list they just automatically delete themselves and I end up wasting my data again. Please check if there is a bug in the system."
I cannot open the application.. I don't know why
Seems ok ðŸ‘Œ
"Last choice to watch, too much filth, perversion and sex or ""from Helll"" demons and evil not enough just decent family friendly, uplifting, encouraging or clean funny programming. It's just not worth digging thru the filth to find good shows. Specially since the preview plays whether you want to see it or not. I don't need my children seeing such adult material, neither do I want to see that stuff. But my previewing choice has been taken away."
"Due to new updates my Netflix app is not opening ,please solve and suggest to others for do not update"
"Use to be a good service but the selection of shows and movies have gotten worse, and the monthly cost has increased substantially with nothing to show for it."
I can sign it in in any other device except my own phone. It says too many login attempts. How to fix it?
Previously I was able to use other apps while watching Netflix in a small box at the corner of my screen. This latest update took this away and I am not able to watch and use other apps when I need to. Fix it please.
"Some shows and films are inappropriate and should not aired. The film Cuties is a prime example. Exploiting children as a means of telling a story about children being exploited is a disservice and negates the alledged purpose of the film. I am disappointed in Netflix's decision to keep this film on. The Obamas, who are financial pushers, should be ashamed of themselves."
Too social. It doesnt ajust to my tastes
Can u like post a miraculous ladybug all seasons and episodes cause im craving of watching them and Please can u like post all the latest movies like IT 2 you haven't posted some yet
The movies and series are nice but won't work after a day so i have to keep reinstalling Netflix
"So, I downloaded the app, and when i sighned in it didnt let me go to the Netflix home screen. I sighned in and sighned out multiple times but it didnt let me in. It was annoying. It just kept bringing me back to that screen where it says on the bottom ""Try out for 30 days free"" somethimg like that. And that is why i only gave it two stars."
Why doesnt it support portrait/vertical view on phone/tablets? Its really annoying while trying to watch while lying down. Having an option to watch vertically would harm no one either.
There are lot of good korean dramas that wasn't available in this app.
It's the best streaming platform but since the new update we can't watch our favourite shows in a miniscreen please fix it
u have to have new movies and shows
Im having problem while open this app and start a movie. The sound is there but the screen just turn black. Please fix it. I dont have problem with my phone because before there is no issue until the new update.
ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’
It keeps on freezing.
Very glitchy and the screen turns black. I have very good internet connection and have noticed this is just when using netflix. I think there maybe a glitch in the system.
"Great service, but mediocre app with very limited functionality that makes you want to use a real browser to see more details or effectively use tags to search precisely what you look for. As an example; I've recently been in the mood for some hong kong based movies, so when visiting Netflix from a browser on my PC, I can easily click on tags (style, genre, country, actor name, etc..) to pull up other movies with the exact same tag. You cannot even SEE those tags with the app unfortunately."
From a very
struggling to open app. my success percentage of opening and watching netflix in my a50s is 30% ! keep uninstall and updating it back and forth in my phone. right now i cant open netflix at all. is it because i just updated software in a50s? please help. thank you.
"Where the ""Dark"" theme?"
Vg
The show are dark
people living in Pakistan need Hindi language support please add Hindi language too
Can't watch it on my language in Europe. I wander if Amazon any better?
Playback is not working after the new upgrade. I thought upgrade was to make an app better not worse.
Just dark screen with sound
They took good movies and series out. That's sad
"While the service in itself is pretty good, the app could be significantly better and more stable. Gave me an error every time I started the app (error code -1001). Neither reinstall of the app or logging out and in made any difference. The only solution turned out to be restarting my phone. This has never happened with any other app."
Previois update version was much better than this one because now it just show movie thumbnails before it showed special and cool poster after clicking on any of the movie or series
Too expensive
"Great service, but doesn't work on my older Nvidia Shield Tablet anymore. It's the only service that doesn't work, and the only device I own that doesn't work with the app."
"Ezs,ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‰ f. Aw. :"

"Horrible! Ever since the second last updated I've been receiving an error message ""-1023"" and the app works when it's in a mood. Tried VPN and using several networks, but still receive the same error. This has been raised on several occasions and there is still no solution."
Could be better for what I pay monthly
Too dark. Can't see a thing. Tried to brighten my screen but says cam be cos app is using it. :-(
"Whatever I download offline keeps deleting by itself, I don't know what to do."
Why cant i connect to netflix. I cannot open it what happened
"My app is unwell because its always saying that ""Something wrong in this device"". When I always open it keep telling that word!! I'm very disappointed ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”"
Essentially they have some great shows that exist to keep people subscribed and pay the bills while Netflix pumps out left wing propaganda.
"Not so great, particularly the search option"
It forces me to update the app to be able to download episodes its annoyingly inconvenient...
Too many glitches . I am constantly having to Uninstall and install over and over
"I LOVE THIS MAN WHO GAVE HIS LIFE FOD ME, JESUS. JHON 3-16 AMO ESTE HOMBRE QUE DIO SU VIDA POR MI, JESUS. JUAN 3-16"

Recently updated payment but app is crashing.not able to run the app
We used the code to subscribe for a year but never got to watch anything because my father had to go to the hospital for two months we found out he had cancer. Didn't do us any good. The anyway
It's glitching very badly! I've tried it out with at least 5-6 contents...the video stops playing at a point and then I have to cancel the video and resume after a while if I want to watch a thing. My internet connection is 20mbps and its in full connected range and only my device is using it but still my videos are automatically shutting down and glitching and just bizzarely stops playing but the audio goes on...Fix This and stop cancelling good shows!!!!
no marvel movies
They took money out of my account automatically without my knowledge when I had no intention on paying for the account at the moment when I needed the money for other things It would be wise to actually let the person pay the account their self instead of just taking the money
June oz. ; In
Netflix needs to add more movies I mean new bollywood or hollywood movies
Should work on child lock features
Content is very good but..Since last two updates..its been crashing very much on my all the devices so fix is highly needed!
I'm not sure how much you can save money
Old movies
The latest version has somehow tampered with its pop-out window feature. I am not able to have my Netflix player playing the video while I'm doing something else on my phone.
When i start up the movie i watch it keep saying please log in again / we cant reach netflix service
"It's getting boring. Old shows, same old movies, few good originals, not many third part productions. Netflix isn't in anyway justified to ask for $16.99 a month for 4K streaming and only 4 accounts when prime video is available with quality content with 4K and six accounts under one primary account for just $6.50 a month. Netflix is not recommended."
"I can't log in to my Vivo S1 pro. It always says that ""too many log in attempt"". I tried every diagnostics that Netflix says, but no one works."
My Netflix just completely stopped working to the point where it dont wanna work or open anymore
"2 stars bc when I dowloaded the app, I signed in but it tells me to ""start a free trial"" does this app now needs payment??"

I like alot of the tv shows but it never saves my spot on resume i have to find my spot each time
Somehow
I loved Netflix but not anymore subpar programming and forced diversity with a twist of gay on left leaning legs. (TV is an escape for me I'm sick of being hit over the head with political agendas.) There are no more family's that look like mine anymore. For that reason I'm out. You can make whatever shows you want but I dont have to pay for it. I was a loyal customer since 2010.

What really sucks is that you put something on your list and poof gone before you can watch i keep getting emails for new releases but no new shows come on new releases section where is a list on the new stuff and a list on stuff that got removed or is being removed
Watching shows is fun. But whenever i connect with wireless earbuds the audio lags. And it only lags on netflix all the other apps work fine.

I have downloaded 2 times. But cant log in. The moment i clik on the pp i am directed to my home screen. I cant even open it
The content and the UI is awesome. But the mirroring on Chromecast is not working in the current version of the app. The app after freezing for couple of minutes shows an error message stating cannot connect to TV.
It always stops. It crashes

I was watching karate kid and didnt finish is so I was going to watch the rest the next day and they decide to take it off Netflix out of nowhere its seem like they have a bunch of bad shows and movies but they ALWAYS remove the good ones.
No way to view current resolution/quality.
Freezes alot needs updating constantly and doesn't play the whole show or movie.
App is not working for more than 3 days. Why this issue is coming? Already updated and re-installed for 5-6 times but still its not getting open.
All old movies no new and when I go for help it doesn't help at all the only good in it that the movies are clear only other than that useless
Its not opening i already recharged It
Y my app is not working properly
"Hello Netflix. Until 1st of August, I would have rated you guys 5 star. But since the past 2 updates, things are so bad. I'm sorry. Unable to download, unable to stream more than 15 min. I'm rating you 1 star so that you'd look into this. This is one of my favorite apps for past 2 years. Please dont fall so far."
Expensive
u can not watch any content while connecting to smart tv.For that u need to recharge with higher amount. While this problem is not with other movie application.
I have a high speed internet connection mostly around 45mbps and i have a phone that supports qhd and account for uhd but still the playback is in low quality and i have checked the settings pls add an option that locks the receloution at qhd please
App stops downloading at 99%!!! I've uninatalled the app and reinstalled. I've cleared the data and cache. Nothing works!!! The price of data in SA makes this unacceptable.
Nothing eve new. Same old.
It's amazing
Bro katai
"it's not working properly, i get a black screen everytime i try to watch anything while the sound is playing in the background"
Some of the shows are worth watching but some of them are in poor taste and should not have been produced in the first place.
Bs me wow ka a AZ hand and a hjna
NOT BAD
Its good but when i was watching stranger things it was not moving at all its so disapointed its suppose to give it 5 stars but it kinda SUCKS i wouldn't say that to an app but it is very bad quality and my screen freezes all the time even tho i have really Fast wifiðŸ˜¶
How to stop Netflix from sending me movie updates!
I cant open the apps it closes by itself
I really enjoy the app however after changing plans it takes forever to load an episode..I then have to uninstall the app...then install and then restart my phone...this is beginning to piss me off.
Add a option to use your Google play balance!!!!
"1. Not giving details about updates is infuriating. 2. Downloads aren't REALLY downloaded to device: App requires/uses up data if not on wifi. It also says it takes 8 hrs to changing to ""do not use data"" (although it STILL requires data if no wifi) EVEN for watching downloads?! WHAT is the point of ""download"" if it doesn't actually download to your device to watch later w/out wifi or data connection?? This ate up ALL my data in a few hrs while watching ""downloads"" I had set up not knowing this."
Bring back all the seasons of Transformers Prime please. Otherwise I would have to go to youtube and watch it there.
No good content of my like. No new movies. I m not too happy
Y do we have to pay over 4 thousand naira it's too expensive ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
Update failure becomes glitchy when previewing trailers
Good
Hl i9m bin
The app subscription price is too much because the list of movies and series are not that good.
The app is not accepting payments through debit cards. The gateway sends otp after 15 min
Good
App is fine but the service and actual content not so much.
Ok
"Can you able to add upi payment method in Netflix ,every time paying in card and monthly payments are quite difficult can you able to arrange 6 month package or yearly packages"
Pls fix fhe chromecast bug
Please add UPI and more debit cards in payment option.
I cant watch anything when i watch a video it will go blank
"You don't have the anime seasons like 2, 3, 4 ,5"
I can't watch Netflix I tried to reset my password but everytime I try to login with facebook it doesn't work so I hate it
What i need buy it
Uses too much data
"Smart downloads doesn't download by episode sequence, it always downloads randomly especially the last of the set. So that I can watch as the next episode finished downloading and downloads others while I'm watching."
My experience with Netflix was really good but now every other day it's shows lot's of problems like 2.2 n 3.2 and something other problems like when I sign out n want to sign in again says too many attempt only by doing once very disappointed
Would be better if I could disable the automatic play next feature.
The app keep error
After this update the episodes start from start instead where we stopped watching . Plz fix it's very annoying
"Since I have changed my mobile (Redmi 9) app is not working. Error (-1001) showing every time. I have reboot my device, changed my network but results are same. Please check"
No new movies
I used to like Netflix but now a days it's sucks
I need to reboot my phone every time I try to connect to my TV
All I'm trying to do watch one movie but it says I can't watch it because it only plays in the us and I can't change my region all a wanted to do was watch this one but I can't even do that.
It cost u money n constantly playing adds
Cant start. { save with google smart lock }
It needs internet everywhere you go if you don't have internet you can't watch it
"There are some trouble in my netflix. I couldn't Open my netflix ,it says error... i wish this can be better.."
"My Netflix app started to rewind after I paused/idled since your upgrade and I had to go back and find where or which episode I had left on... I loved the older version! What's happening? The new upgraded version should be better and make my viewing experience better, right?"
Everything I try to watch stuff on Netflix after update it keeps giving me a error
A movie like Drum Line.
Political brain washing
Almost all my items in My List have disappeared.
"Very bad payment system, as we can not pay through our choice of payment mode. i.e. Payment through BHIM, Paytm, Yono, etc, it just overcomes and dances on customer's had to pay through their choice of payment mode !! And they made it compalsary to save the payment details, and even no one can delete it for privacy and security! How insane !! My subscription ends with end of September for which i've paid already, however I'm unable to use the video streaming. How rubbish."
Why are my downloads not appearing on the tv?
"Not many good movies. When we do request a film it doesn't get aknowldeged. They didnt upload Arrow season 8 although ""Crisis on Infinity earths"" was in December last year. All karate kids were taken off as Cobra Kai took off."
ONLY reason I got it was for That 70s Show and The Office ....why did you take out That 70s Show?!?!
The most recent update has made the issues from last time worst making it so I can barely get on the app without something happening and will now only load a certain point even if I have gone past it
Bad.it not interesting.plz add some futures
I would like to know how i can undo the current update. In previous version it was keeping track what i was watching and from where to continue. In this version i have to navigate to where i left by myself which feels annoying considering previous experience. ðŸ˜– Otherwise it is 5 star.
"For now my subscription will remain on hold, but I'm keeping my Amazon prime video. Personally I found netflix itself to be a bit meh, the app works great but I found the library very limited and loaded with boring dribble. Maybe I'll try Stan instead."
"This App Is Good , But It Has More Updates And Waste of net and No use of Update !!"
Sir pls fix this app it is login in account pls fix it sit
App not opening after renewing the membership
Good app. But can't cast to my mitv 4 a. Android version. And there is no app for mitv 4 a. When I am cast to TV only sound and subtitles are coming not picture. Is there any app for TV?
Netflix is not working in a50s
Lovely
four because it's not five however if I watch an episode or movie suddenly it will stop I don't know why
"Since the new update you guys screwed up the video quality, it lags so much now, get it fixed ASAP."
Since July I cant open this app without reinstalling it back. I dont know why but it is really inconvenient for me.
Why you take that 70s show off Netflix that's not cool
"Hulu is better. Just saying. Sorry, not sorry."
"App maxes out at 960x540 resolution even though phone (LG V30), internet speeds (110mbps) and Netflix plan (premium) support 3860x1440. No user setting available. Not fixed by deleting/reinstalling. Very frustrating to be paying for 4K and getting one step above SD. Why resolution isn't a user selectable setting like YouTube is beyond me."
"ive really needed u guys to put mulan on it, im waiting, u guys gotta stop removing movies, u need to put mulan 2020 bc ive been dying t see it, plz plz plz netflix get mulan 2020 on netflix"
You can't change the subtitles' colors so tough luck seeing the white text on a white background. And why isn't there a list of the whole library? Why do I have to be fed what to watch forcefully with no room to explore what I am paying money for.
It was awesome before now it sucks im watching an anime inuyasha it was just auto remove to my list we are watching it with family. Updated my app religiously. My payment is also updated! What's wrong fix your app! I was supposed to upgrade. I will not upgrade unless u fix your app. Gosh!
"The simultaneous watching isn't working for me. Wherever my brother is also watching on his phone, the app on my phone continuously refuses to load the next episode of a show after watching just one or two episodes. It gets stuck on the loading screen. Sometimes I can get an episode to play if I select one from a different show or restart my phone completely. But it's nearly impossible to binge a show without interruption."
An error occurs when I am watching where the video stops while the voice continues...it really maked me stop watching my favourite series
Ok
Everytime i start a new show that everyone talks about they always remove it stop removing good shows.
"Who doesn't love Netflix. I mean just an amazing idea and I have been with them since they started. My problem is there is a super annoying bug where everytime I leave the app to answer a message or take a phonecall on whatsapp, it just decides to not want to play anything anymore until I restart my phone. I've been dealing with this for months now just hoping they would fix it but they haven't. FYI im using a Huawei P30 Pro."
#Feedback There should be an option to clear continue watching within the app. Please inbuilt it as soon as possible.
"I am not even able to install this application in my device, I thought my only having some issues but all other applications are able to access I don't know why Netflix is not able to download"
Not able to open..
I used to use this app a lot but since the new update I haven't been able to log in as as soon at a tap to sign in it kicks me out the app and I've uninstalled this app so many times then reinstalled it but it still isn't working please can somebody fix this.
Open any apps in the background and Netflix be like: sorry we don't do that here ...I mean like what the actual **** and now got a netflix widget update that got stuck on my notification bar and when I disabled notif temporarily so that it go away now the app won't work at all and had to uninstall and reinstall again losing all my downloads ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
Application won't open
Its 2 stars bc you need to pay but its but guys if you want to watch free movies install POPCORN TIME free to watch movies if it works thank me later:)))))
Add a video quality selector to the player
I hope they will accept prepaid payment soonðŸ™
"I used to really like Netflix. As time goes on, I like it less because they cycle through their library ridiculously fast, purging stuff that isn't generating enough interest. I get that licensing costs money, but there is no point in adding stuff to your list to come back to later to share with someone or watch again. Every time I do this, I come back and find most of the stuff in my list is gone. Even more stupid, they'll get movies or seasons 1 and 3 of a series but not the middle one."
Can you stop f lagging .idk what it is but I cant watch this on my phone because it lags and no it's not my wifi bc it's good and my phone is new so yeah bro stop f lagging brotha.also theirs to much irrelevant bs in the screen.movies Idgaf about or have nothing related to what iv watched.
Netflix doesn't allow me to use a plan for mobile. Although there is a payment option but it is not working. The app only allow credit or debit method which is annoying. Had to uninstall and re intall the app thingking it might fix the issue but no it is as it is same issue every time.
I dont understand why netflix have to delete all of the anime movies/series ...we bought netflix because we wanted to watch anime but now you're deleting all the anime movies . I literally payed for nothing.
No log out option on tablets. Have to delete and reinstall daily
"Great on my phone, no issues. I have this downloaded on Dragon Touch tablets for the kids (literally the only reason they have tablets) and downloads of shows and movies are no longer compatible with the device. They're laid out exactly like an Android phone so I'm not sure why this isn't an option but it would be great to get this fixed."
"Every time I come back to a series, netflix doesn't show me the episode were I left off. It instead goes a few episodes back"
Not good because some movies already in DVD but nothing on netflix. Even the some old movies are not on netflix.
"The latest update is annoying. The app always closes itself, unable to play video, and my downloads keeps in getting deleted. This does not happen on the last version, I should not have updated the app. ðŸ˜”"
It stopped working
Your speed is trash your combat speed is trash your strength is trash and your endurance is lacking
The app cost so much money that I cannot buy a subscription to watch my favourite Hollywood movies. My request is please make this app cheap for Bangladesh. I wanted to buy the 7 USD pack but I can't because it costs 593 BDT only for a single month which is very costly in our country. Please make the subscriptions cheap.
"Netflix been stopping ,i hate it. I always uninstall then download again it for it to work again ,it sucks. Can you please fix this."
Helpful

Are you for real? The anime variety has never really been big and now your removing some of the best ones? I was hoping to see more animes or atleast the full anime with all season but they get removed and that for what like I'm seriously thinking of giving up on Netflix.

"Hi , In India, Everyone does not know Hindi So Please Stop playing Video in Hindi by default. India has 22 scheduled Language."
Can't minimize the app. Please fix!! I use that a lot
"I paid more just so i can watch it on our tv. But it doesn't work. The movies playing but screen is just black and i can only see the subs(both phone and tv screen). I tried downloading the movies but it's just the same. At first i thought there's a bug so i reinstalled the app but it didn't work. Everytime I turned off the screen cast, the movies play completely well. Used other apps while screen sharing and they work just fine. How annoying!! I paid more for nothing! Fix this"
"The last could if days, the so would take more than a minute to show the home screen"
"Hoy crear, difficult yo organize or chose"
After the update its getting stuck while playing
"It is good, the quality and the variety of shows and movies but I can't get into the app itself, It always get stuck."
I can't watch without pay.

I enjoy this app except lately i have to uninstall it every night on my tablet an reinstall it because i get an error like 12012. Seriously its getting old. I am thinking of cancelling. I have this on my roku and all of a sudden the netflix app will just stop in the middle of what I'm watching and shut off. So yes i am considering getting rid of netflix and going back to hulu. Unless it can be fixed and you can refund some money i might stay.
There are many movies and series which are not available In India.. It's Disappointing
The august upgrade ruined it. Unable to watch anything!
"I tried signing up with my card on the 4th of sept 2020,They clearly stated that my card is not enabled for international transactions yet i was debited.I have been waiting for a reverse yet nothing.I am in Nigeria and i would like for it to be fixed straight up.I cant pay for what i didnt get."
"The extreme variation in the films available in different countries is terribly annoying. So those not residing in USA are pretty much dumped a shoddy list of hollywood. Please get more and better european (or even american) movies to stream. Do something, there should be more equality, the movies here (India) are limited and most of what I search is not available (not to mention your weird search engine.)"
"Not able to play any apps recently, no clue."
The screen is blacking out when viewing a show.
Y'all are taking away the only show i like and it makes me honestly want to cancel my subscription
Can't get into the app.
I used to love Netflix but i just pd my bill 9-4-20 and the money came out of my acct but it will not let me get into the app at all now it flash on and flashes off that quick before i pd it would at least come on ask me to upgrade and become a member again so i choose 15.99 for 4 devices and now we cant log in at all pls answer my questions and tell me what to do i have also emailed u as well.. thks
"Needs better options. 1.And this is the biggest: There should be a way to pick out certain movies and say ""not interested"" so that it stops appearing/suggesting those unwanted titles 2.A way to suggest movies you would want to see in the future. 3.Better searching capabilities. There has been a few times I searched for something like anime expecting all the titles to come up but it'll leave alot out. 4.Better rating system and maybe even a way to leave a review or comments on some movies."
It's a best app no problem in it iam using it from a long time but the think is there is no more picture in picture mode available that will creates trouble for the watcher like me i think Netflix must update it ASAP because it is the wish of many watchers I think Netflix understand.
"Everytime there's a good movie or show they put on there, they take it off. Its like when I remember it and i wanna whatch it again, i look it up and its gone. Then I become depresso. Everything else is fine tho"
Best ever
Netflix is getting pretty lagy and you guys are getting pretty lazy on the shows i went to go watch my fav movie and it was not there
My 30 day free trial was suddenly turned into a 10 day free trial. No way I'm going to subscribe knowing that they can bill me 3 times a month.
So I had a lot of fun but now I'm having a issues it won't load it takes for ever So please fix this if its possible
"Don't like the fact that I have to download with my data, and still can't save movies on my phone"
Why do you delete so many anime?? that's makes it bad
"Having troubles to log in even after uninstalling and installing it again,I don't know how to go about it.It is asking me to choose a Google account but if I do so,it's still not allowing me ...."
U should start UPI payment
From few days there is a problem in Netflix that i can't have continue watching option at home screen this problem is with all the 5 screens and this not only happening in android app but in your windows app and website please fix it
Cant watch anything the picture will freeze or just go black and only sound will play so all the shows i want to watch i cant fix it and my rating improves
It keeps locking me out after a day or two
"Well pretty poor experience so far. Got it by chance running on the mobile. On the Android box it doesn't show up in the play store, apparently the beta testing not available at the time. I guess my subscription won't last long under given circumstances."
They cancelled my favorite shows
"Can't change video size to fit to screen, letterbox viewing only, can't properly search for things to watch, only the rubbish lists of trending now, continue watching for me (it was pants that's why we didn't watch it all). Please just a put a complete list of everything on Netflix as current layout makes it impossible to find anything that we didn't watch a year ago."
Dull need more recent and new movies and programmes not out dated ones. Sort it out people
What is wrong with the app? I just renewed my subscription and also updated the app but the app cannot be open. Please help
"I hate the new brightness controls. I had no issues using my phone brightness settings, but now that Netflix has independent brightness settings I keep accidentally dimming and brightening the show. Please let me toggle this setting off! It's unnecessary and obnoxious. It's been months, and this still pisses me off regularly. Minus another star."
It keeps crashing or the video does not play. There's sounds but black screen

I am facing an issue even I uninstalled netflix and installed it again. The issue is whenever I opened netflix it pops up message which account to choose but after clicking on account instead of opening netflix furthur ; closed the app. I tried many times. Please look into this as soon as possible.
Technical issues are there
I payed my subscription and as soon as paid it asked for my phone number for verification and now kicks me completely out. I tried opening the app up again and again and still shows signing in then kicks me out once again.

"This review is more about the overall service than the app. Netflix prices have increased so many times since I've been a customer, it has nearly doubled. For awhile, I cannot find anything on the service to watch, there just isn't enough variety. Amazon has 5 times the movies and more TV shows and streaming speeds are 3-5 times faster than Netflix. Amazon is $50/yr. less than Netflix and you get free 2-day shipping and music cloud storage as well. Regarding the app, it is poorly laid out. A gigantic banner that promotes just one movie wastes about 30% of your screen. The sections duplicate too many titles and the ""Continue Watching"" section keeps too many titles you've already seen. Also, if a movie was started and you watched only 10-15 minutes because you didn't like it, it should be removed after a certain amount of time. This section often contains shows I've never even started. The frequent interruptions of ""Are you still watching?"" messages are annoying. Why do these appear during the show instead of before or after an episode? It makes no sense. Having individual viewing accounts is good but why do i have to select it every time if I'm the only one viewing content on my TV? There should be a cookie to save this choice but allow you the option of changing it. There should be an option to filter out non-English language movies. Sometimes I'm just not in the mood to read subtitles."
"Subtitle size is too large, even after changing it in settings"
The last two weeks it won't connect on my phone. Evey two day I have a problem with it. Says error try again later.
It's opening an then closing not loading up at all would give a better ranking if it gets fixed
Full screen not working on my OnePlus 8. Please fix this issue I will give it 5 star

"No picture in picture mode? Not even rotation?? Cmon, Netflix! What's wrong with you?"
This not good enough
"App asking to choose account, when do it goes back to home page before it was working good but don't know what's going on now."
The app keeps crashing after a pop up to choose Google smart lock account. It doesn't let me stay or login into my account. Now I've used the app before and this is the first time I'm experiencing this glitch. Please fix it. I see a couple of other reviews stating the same problem too.
"I recently bought a new phone and tried playing netflix via screen mirroring. I only hear audio, no video. Only black screen. I have reinstalled netflix, cleared the cache etc, still, not working. This is so frustrating. Other apps like youtube is working fine. Is this because of netflix's recent update? Pls fix this issue."
"Add the newest 2018 Jurassic Park movie and also add back The Cujo, Both Quiet Place Movies,Water Horse,Straw Dogs, The Neighbor,Get Out, Shiloh,Misery,New Pet Semetary Movie,Side Effects,Contagion,Orca,and other movies ..."
The app will not update
"Too dark, only app that says that the brightness is being controlled by another app. Just started happening"
Nice app i like it
"very not optimized in Samsung Galaxy A50s device, please fix this. the app keep showing error popup"
My phone version is 4.4.4 . after the netflix update i downloaded it after opening the app there is only email and password option is there but no number option to sign in please give that option
Sometimes it's does not work properly
It'so hard to connect. I hate it.
Some new episodes are not visible on some account but in other account are visible ? Bug? Hope it will fix
Rather expensive for all the choices I now have.
"App used to work pretty good. Unfortunately now after the latest update, on opening the app it just minimises and renders it unusable. It stays open but you cannot do anything on it. Just Minimised and unable to use it!"
Netflix is a wonderful app but why do we have to pay so much money you can't we get HD for 200 and we are paying 200 and we are only getting 1 account this is why most of the people are not using netflix
Ok not bad
After the upgrade the many items I had in My List disappeared. It will take hours to do it again.
Wow
Please add a filter option for movies which are available in hindi and also in android app there is option of playback speed but in ipad there is not and in ipad it has a option of volume control but in android it has not and when I open Netflix on ky smart TV it makes it's theme sound but in mobile app it doesn't..why??????? Please give every feature all OS
Needs a new update or something. I can't even watch one episode without it freezing or black screen. Please fix!
I'm just going to put this out there I don't like Netflix that much.
"it only allowed me on the app once, now it says device error occured"
"This app usually works fine. But this last update has made it so that whenever I start watching something, if I stop and come back to it, it will pick up where I started watching instead of where I ended. If this could get fixed, that would be great."
"says i need to update payment yet it doesnt accept any updated payment option i input, weather funded debit card, updated credit card or charge to phone no. with substancial credit limit."
Really Netflix??? Can't you get any decent movies. All your about is series and older movies. I pay monthly for garbage. Can't you get some good movies??????
"Netflix needs to give us more classic movies and shows and stop filling our recommended with terrible, trashy, and cliche Netflix originals. I'm over it. I love this app but it's going to be a sad day when Netflix is nothing but their cringy movies."
This app is great but when my payment runs out I need to reset my watched shows and I didn't know a downloaded can expire! And mostly my favorite show is not there some of the shows are not there too! Please add Miraculous to the show but I would like to give it a 2 star
"Normally would rate higher but content hasn't changed much recently and now it's buggy. Keep getting a log in error every time I try to watch something on my tablet, meaning I have to force stop and clear everything every night to watch something. All systems are up to date so its not that..."
The update I have to erase one of my games that's not happening.ðŸ˜¡ But the videos are good ðŸ‘Œ but the update no ðŸ˜¡
"Removing The League of Gentlemen for 'blackface' - don't you retards understand the concept of CONTEXT. Netflix gotta be ""woke"". Pathetic!"
Stop taking away the good Shows
"I love Netflix, but I just hate the fact that I can't access alot of things to watch due to my location. Like why does it have to provide a smaller number of options on the shows to watch for people according to their location?"
Ø¹Ù†
Ok this app is super according what I hear about it from my friends but when I try to load it they say unfortunately Netflix is not supported in your country why?!!!
Netflix is frozen .... Moment after my payment is through...? Why...
Lured in by a free trial then BOOM!! charged money.
Netflix app has major issues. There is a bug that needs to be fixed or something because it keeps force closing. Even with the update.
Don't stop to push me out when I start the app. Ne cesse de planter quand je lance l'appli.
It is not working on my phone i have samsung galxy s6 can any one tell me why.???
Some times the movies which are released in netfilx doesnt show up
"Screen goes dark, I get on tech support and they say click here and no fix..."
I like neflix but with the new update i cant get past the sign in tab. I just want to watch netflix on the go
Why many time app not login and then i uninstall this app and agin install why ????
"I thought netflix is above all, and you can find & watch whatever you want in it, but I m not able to get the movies I love to watch, there are so many unavailable movies, what's the use of it when I can't get what I want to watch."
"I changed my password yesterday, but couldn't login with that password today. Recently having such such small issues with the app. Never expected this even after paying so much! And again changed the password today but not able to login as it's showing too many login attempts. Even after uninstalling and installing again, the same message is displayed."
"Good app. Please add ""Transcendence"" (2014 movie)..... Hurry up"
It it is not really good â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸
"This app should also be paid by prepaid load or something, so that others can easily pay thair bills and to enjoy more about this app. It's more unfair for those who don't have any credit card. I hope someone will notice my feed back. Thanksss"
I would give you more than stars I could give you if you add game of thrones I am already a Netflix user why can't u people purchase it's rights in india

"Says on everything except search that it cannot connect to server, i have 4 bars and everything elts i have works, i can search for what i was watching and scroll threw the episodes but i have to do it each time -_-"
Evert time i use Norton VPN it automatically changes the country from Netflix even if I turn of the VPN it's still a different country.
Your app is beautiful but I wish you stop the lesbian and nudity content
"After this new update, video pauses automatically and when click on play button, we can't resume the video. It's so troubling."
"Netflix is great and all that, but the app randomly started giving recommendations throuhj notification since yesterday. Dislike."
Dicently good app. But recently the screen is blacking out while playing any video.. The light dims ever time a video is played

My experience was good until i found out every OTHER country had better shows than we do.
"Unable to connect to Netflix. Keeps on giving me error -1001. ""Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later."""
Don't know where to start about how bad netflix is you can't fimd the movies you search but if u search a movie from a different movie app surprise netflix suddenly has it so that's my thoughts
Should put in more anime in this app and im sure it will boost up people using this. I mean all anime should be updated. Please developer?
The app should have a clear watch history button.
Give it two because you must pay that is bad
Nicely done 1
Not allowing me to login ! ðŸ§
Needs my hero academia
I have to force quit under app info and press open in order to use it. Ive done everything possible i can think of to fix it. Even cleared cache and uninstalled it. Yeah fix plz Thanks
"It's not good right now, whenever I open the app this thing asking me to choose a Google account pops up, I choose then it gets me out of the app, so I opened it, and the same thing popped up, this happened over and over again. Although, I used to have this app and it worked perfectly and it was great, but now it won't let me in."
where is jojo part 5??? we need it now
Need to update frequently
Very good.
Support Mobile Bill plz ...!!
"I dont like Netflix as much any more because they keep on taking off my favorite movies tv shows and I'm tired of seeing ("" this movie will be available until November 7th"") I am just so tired of seeing that. Plus the fact that you took it off and you put it back on but now you're taking it back off againit is so annoying!!! I hate it. And there is no way that you can take off that 70's show. That is one of the best shows ever. I'm getting tired of this"
"The app does not remember where I left off nor does a video player appear for watching while doing something else (a screen within a screen), as it used to. Only since the new update last week. Rating 2 stars."
"Since the recent update I get a connection error message when I try to play anything. I've tried working through the suggestions (sign in online, sign out and back in on the app, check wifi, reinstall etc) but the only thing that works is clearing the app data and starting again. The app loads and it refreshes the content and updates my continue to watch so it's not an Internet issue. Was fine before the update on the 24th and it's only on my android tablet ,my android phone has no issues."
Need hdr update for huawei mate 30
I love this app but the new updates of seasons aren't yet on like love alarm its been posted since August 22 and its still not up
Kul
The latest update is very disappointing
Not good ..hangs many time and consumes relatively more data
Sticking
I am not able to watch any movies or series in full screen
"Gonna end my subscription if you still not fix this and keep on suggesting OLD OLD OLD movies, I can't even search a movie and always shows error!"

"This app is very convenient for use on my Android mobile. However, it has its faults. After some time of watching videos, the picture stops but the audio continues. I then get an error directly following and it requires the app to be restarted. This is no issue on my end, my internet and device specifications are significantly more than required. The app is also up to date. This issue has been failed to be corrected over the last 4 updates."
"I wish my favorite show would stop coming off of Netflix, and I wish they would add new stuff but also leave the old stuff on it. So that all that really needs fixing."
Too bad
Not updating stuck on 99%
Unable to open app in phone
The app used to work great in the beginning and now it isn't opening on my phone. The only way I'm able to watch movies or tv shows is if I connect to my laptop. So inconvenient.
"You guys are all crack heads for allowing that ""Cuties"" movie to be on your service. Semi-joke review."
In anime it is only filler episode
Garbage everything is old movies are old TV shows are might be 6 decent shows to watch
i love it
"I'm unable to access the PIP MODE after the last update, I have granted all special access to the app from the phone, please fix the issue asap."
I'm not being able to download the app please help . It's showing waiting for download since yesterday .
Errors continously.
Good and excellent
"The latest android version corrupts often and requires i delete application cache in order to access the Chromecast icon, didnt have this problem at all on the prev version."
The series and shows im watching have more than what Netflix has it needs to be upto date with newer releases for episodes
Emmm why i can't open the app on My Phone?
"The new update is really bad, it doesnt load and the shows when played in the background, dont get updated to the episode you are on when you go back to them."
Boring.
It's always no sound.always need restart device after that sound start working.and after watch another movie it again no sound.no i just fed p
"It's nearly impossible to find videos. the same few are presented over and over under different headings. Netflix, you're not fooling anyone."
"The app is pretty good. Except since the late update casting to chromecast is now completely broken, it seems like it keeps losing connection to the chromecast, which makes the notification disappear, meaning you can no longer control what's on the screen! When you try and reconnect the app annoyingly starts whatever was casting from the beginning again!"
I so netflix in other phones i love it
"The layout of the app is perfect, however when I open the app it occasionally doesn't load. Obviously, this isn't what you pay for when you buy a subscription, you're supposed to be able to watch Netflix. Simple bug fixes that could easily be fixed but haven't been seen to for months."
The charges are too high in comparison to the content updation rate...I can see the same content after one year of starting to use
"New update not much user-friendly, when clicked any show it is showing short info and again need to click to see episode. Not necessary, it irritates"
Too pricey. And irrelevant content.
"Has been very buggy since the last update. Doesn't play when closing one video to play another, it just keeps loading. Also it keeps losing track of progress and starts from beginning"
"Why does it shows ""couldn't connect to netflix service"" every time I open the app!?"
"For some reason it has barely any good movies, and lacks many episodes like the whole 7th season of the 100 and also the last 5 episodes of rick and morty and it took so long for the last season of rick and morty to come to netflix like tf? I watch most movies from sites on google for free so it's pointless to have netflix"
Content censorship is ridiculous. Removing episodes from Community due to your inability to understand history and overcorrecting will just hurt the platform and annoy customers.
Please add TM in postpaid payment option
"if watching something and switching to another app and then coming back to the app it either gives an error that never goes away unless the app is closed, or it plays but with a blank screen also requiring closing and opening again."
I want netflix lite for tecno L8lite
Since the last upgrade Netflix isn't working properly..
Good
Buffering ..... always buffering.... And my other streaming services work fine.
"Widevine ruined our subscription, we can not play hd content in widevine l3 devices. It is sad cause most of our phones are capable of playing FHD and we are stuck in 480p SD . I know it is part of providing security to your content/service but on our part we are not satisfied of the service we are paying. Its like you need to buy a l1 certified phone or an iphone before you can play HD videos/movies. Sad realy sad."
After I installed the update it wouldn't let me watch anything ðŸ˜¡
"Notification pop up to share is too frequent and annoying, please remove. Why i should click it everytime i open netflix? It keeps coming many times after."
"Since i updated the app, my downloaded movies even series get to redownload after a day or two. After redownloading it, the next day, it needs to be downloaded again! Unfortunately i haven't watch all of those yet. what's wrong with the app? How can i fix it? ðŸ˜”"
Old Ass Movies
Kept closing on me
"Netflix is a very good streaming app, however,ive been having problems with switching seasons. There's no option available to select another season of the movie I'm watching. I updated it and it's still the same thing. You really need to work on this please."
"Good streaming quality on data, but screen goes entirely too dark and can't adjust brightness."
Not working
Keeps giving errors when trying to watch something. Requires me to log out and back in every time to fix the error. FIX YOUR APP.
Well If there would be Hobbit series then I could give 5 stars so.. please add it.
Good
"Facing an issue with the app. Downloaded content doesn't open until I open it 3 times. The first two times, I meet with the error message ""There is a problem playing the video. Please to again. (2.119)""."
Nathing
"I do loves this app most of the time, but I often get this pop up while watching saying device failure occured, try again error. There is nothing wrong with my internet, YouTube, online games, or phone, everything runs smoothly. Except netflix. Is there a way to make it stop?"
Thanks for the app
Hate it
Bakit hindi ko makita ung gusto ko panoodin
"App is not opening every time i open the app it shows ""sorry , we could not reach the netflix service. Please try again later "" What should i do now...."
Nrw update regularly becomes unresponsive to touch and bringing up contols....
Ok ok
Good app but Iam not eligible for the payment
Fix customer support then 5 star
Boring shows and can't use vpn.
I love this app i can watch some of my favourite movies but Im also starting to hate it. Every yime I open the app half way watching a movie it will say device failure and Netflix will crash its so annoying!!
"My device has an L1 capability but it only shows L3 on the playback capabilities from netflix. I tried clearing the data and L1 capability has been detected, now i can play a movie or a show wiith a black screen with audio"
"Netflix is drowning in Korea novellas! If you're going to do appeal to Asians, please add more variety and from recent years like 2018-2020 kind of recent. It's not just Korean, there's Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, and a whole lot of others too."
Frustrating in extremis
Netflix is kind of confusing. Like it has wrong information and it has missing episodes and series. And if my little pony is there why isn't my little pony the movie there? Also for we bear bears there is only season 2 and 3 available! Like what the heck?! Fix this now!
Too much money
"I loved Netflix, but it has lost it's lackluster!"
. *
"My app updated 2 days ago, and all of a sudden my casting capability was gone. Turns out the update changes your data usage settings. Mine was set to use only wifi, and app decided to change that for me to mobile data with the update. User experience frustrating with things like this"
"I have that captions turn on every episode after I turn them off, it's so annoying"
This app won't let me login on this device through the app but it let's me login on the browser. How do you fix that?
"Very often does not remember the subs that are set between restart of the app. Synch between devices is a mystery, sometimes works and sometimes not(basically i want continue a movie where i have left on yhe other device)... For some serials or movie, the title is in x language but as a subtitle does not even exist the x lang. 2 stars are more than enough!"
We want more anime movie series like dragon ball.
In my device app is not working I have my membership in Netflix but app not letting me go in the app . work on this problem
"I'm disappointed Netflix hasn't been working for 3 days. Every time I try to watch my anime series it tells me there is something wrong with Netflix, and it tells be to sign back in. I've signed in 3 times each day it's getting annoying please fix this."
Suddenly not working with chromecast
"After update Fails to load ""my list"""
In some webseries subtitles dont match with the voice words although the meaning of subtitle sentence and audio is same but if both match exactly the experience would be better
"the app was working perfectly and i didn't have any problems with it, now everytime i want to see something it freezes the video but the audio is still playing. I thought it was a problem with my phone and i try everything to fix it, and when i do it's seems normal until it happens again. I can't enjoy it anymore."
Subtitle's always late or advanced
Good but it's been not steraming the old bollywood movies and the new one on that time
It doesn't support full screen for OnePlus 8 Pro
Very bad
I live in Kenya and we dont get the same shows as America and they dont let us Use Vpn it doesnt work like that. So please do something about it.
Why you are missing so much with buttons ??? I liked the play next why did you take it out? Add more speed up options . More small steps . It will be nice if your app will work with PiP window resizeable....
Inappropriate
Niiice
Every nice App
"The resolution for HD on laptop is bad, why does it have to ""ultra HD"" ?ðŸ™„"
Why can't we cast/mirror on tv when watching using the mobile app?
I often can't use app and has a error pop-up.
It dont even got all da seasons of the anime thet do got on here
Lags
"It used to be good but lately some of the shows and movies keep on disappearing, like Glee, Hunter x Hunter, Gilmore Girls (series), HTGAWM, Friend Zone, etc. At first I thought an update would fix that but no it's still happening. Kindly look into that. Otherwise what's the point of having Netflix when the shows I'm watching suddenly disappears for no reason."
Not saving where I'm at in my shows after last update. Needs to be fixed asap.
ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜—ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜¢
Is bad
menadawood
The app won't allow me to change the brightness on my Samsung Galaxy 20+ 5G. If I try to see a movie or show they are always dark on my screen.
You know what.....Syrians love watching movies and shows ... so can you please stop blocking our country from using this app ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ We need to be more free. Living in Syria: _ payment methods âŒ _ Spotify âŒ _ Netflix âŒ _ anything beautiful in the f**king world âŒ Why?? Why?? Why?? Why??
"I just subscribed, then resetting my account but still unable to sign in. This is not cool. Guys kindly look into this ASAP and regularize tonight."
"Sure, it has good shows. But when you put a show running in background while you do something else on your phone, like text, it resets the progress you made on the show or movie. It opens a second netflix application in the background as well, and when you tab back into either app, you restart your show or movie from the beginning."
"I can't play HD on my device Redmi Note 8 Pro, too bad, please fix it"
so so
It got hanged
It's ok
I was can't able to take screenshots
This used to be good but recently I haven't been able to open the app for some reason Its so annoying I couldn't watch for a month and still cant!
Nice app
The contents are getting worse. I don't know why.
"1. Huawei M5 8"" the picture in picture isn't working even though it's turned on in system settings. 2.Since latest update you keep having to choose your profile. why introduce the extra clicks. please fix this please"

"When cast to chromecast, the navigation button is bad. Only backward 30s no 10s and forward."
"I had to change the subscriptionid so I logged out with still 2 days left for my initial subscription to end. now when I open the app it crashes after showing the logo, when I tries to enter a new account. so I tried to open with my Initial subscription, but it still crashes.

It was good before... Now i cannot sign in... Username password is correct... Still cannot sign in...
"Hi Netflix. I'm unable to search ""Lucifer"" and it is not showing on the list even if I search for it. Kindly assist. Thanks"
Good ðŸ‘ but slow ðŸŒ
Ok thank you u put it back dont remove seasons thst u already put and if u gonna put a new show put all the seasons its annoing
Include video quality options in metered WiFi connections.
So much foreign rubbish on there ðŸ‘Ž
Data quality option like You tube isn't available
"For whatever reason, netflix is constantly slow. It keeps having the reloading symbol whenever I first enter the app or whenever I finish one season and it moves to the next season. I've re-downloaded the app, restarted my phone, turned off wifi, turned on wifi, used data, and nothing works. It lags a lot and buffers. Its very aggravating."
Cancelling actuall good series but continuing a kid twerking show and other bad shows
Need to customize quality
Boe Ã±er Del Pala qualÃ±a
its perfect
There's so many movies that are not here.
Only because they don't add all the seasons to the shows
The movies and others are vanished in my list .. please fix this
Why don't you keep other debit cards for subscribing Netflix please add other debit card also
Good app
"The video for the app would freeze whenever a certain frame in a show would come one of these shows is ""The disastrous life of Saiki K"
Buggy mess after recent update
"Im a monthly subscriber and i cant download any movies why,can u please check for me"
"The application is nice. Previously I had rated it 5 stars but something happened today which made me change my mind. Suddenly I got a message from the bank that Netflix has deducted INR 799 from my account for the subscription which was without my knowledge. However my previous subscriptions were of INR 199 & it was never 799. Even I didn't recharge for the subscription in the last month. So I can say it is a pure fraudulent, that Netflix charges it's customer straight away with no information."
i have stable wifi but it keeps saying that i can't connect to the server when i try to log in or even when i open the app
Kenapa netflix jd sering eror ya :(
Despite contacting costumer care centre. My Netflix is not working properly.. Dnt know why.. Earlier it worked good... Other apps r working nicely.. Like amazon prime etc
Why my Netflix app stuck. It got frozen in the starting....
This app is good but sometime ir stell ur money
Not very satisfying once u don't find what you are looking for. Can you get all seasons of KUWTK and GOT (free version) on Netflix please.
"It doesn't keep the record of where I was watching the last time. It used to do it, but now it gets lagged, it stuck with one chapter. Please fix it."
Postpaid billing fails everytime I try to pay for new subscription. Pls fix this
Cool
It was good
"It's not working on OnePlus 7T, I tried uninstalling it still nothing."
So so
"I will be happier to watch videos with more Chinese subtitles in the Canada region, especially for those Japanese animes. I don't want to watch animes from illegal sources because they are illegal resources. I always like to watch animes with Japanese original voice and Chinese subtitles. For other types of series, I don't mind listening and reading English. Only ANIMES, I can't feel good without Chinese subtitles. Please! I know you have Chinese subtitles in Chinese speaking countries."
"Ever since the update, I am no longer able to use the picture in picture, even though I have it switched to on."
Netflix has been producing poor films and shows and I've seen all I need to see. Every time I get into something it removes it. Not good
Good
"The app keeps dropping the Chromecast icon and the only way to get it back is to reinstall, so I'm doing that multiple times a day now. Also when you select a show/movie it no longer gives you the title. It just shows you an image/poster often with lettering too small for me to read. I'm giving it an F on accessibility."
"Dear Netflix, you should not force people to scroll through a million international movies just to get it back into the American movie section. This somehow tedious and unforeseen feature is not wanted by everyone and it should be an option to opt out of for those whom feel that way. If it doesn't fit Don't Force It. There should be a separate section for foreign movies, I have nothing against them also don't want to scroll that much."
Need more options for the money.
This ver 7.70 build 50.35063 ( 20 August 2020) confirm is the current ver is bug free. 2 STARS at this stage.

"It says it has all the shows from the world but it really doesn't. I've been searching for this kind of show, but it wasn't there. And that show has been there since 2015. :("

Good
"Audio sync is lost when fastforwarded by 10 sec Also auto play opens 1st episode of the season instead of the next one..Waited for updates to fix ,last three updates did not fix this issue ..... Fix this soon this is a paid subscription..."

"The app was okey, the subscription are kind of expensive, but worst thing about the app was that they got rid of the star rating in the app, now all shows a weird percentage that say that basically all movies I will like, or either get rid of the percentage and bring back the stars or fix the percentage system."
"Can anyone help i dont know why whenever i open the app it keeps crashing and logs out straight away, i uninstalled many times and reinstalled with no use, any suggestions??"
Cant stream in HD even if it is L1 Certified device name-xiaomi pocophone F1
Keeps on giving me errors when watching a video and also when I play a video only audio is present I've talked to customer service and done what they told me to do but nothings changed
Subscription issues. There are a lot of them.
Its a good app but they need to add more movies
Would give it more but its not compatible with my invens v12 phone it runs android 8 yet it tells me its not compatible... so dissapointed

"Netflix respond to this please, ok I'm a person who watches ninjago on your app, alot, and it just makes me upset that theirs only 9 seasons, when they have 14 seasons made, so please add atleast 1 more season to watch please do it and I will change these 2 stars into 5."
Nice but they deleted some series and films â˜¹ï¸
This app keeps freezing and won't play or open since the latest update. So frustrating!
Pls make more content have Malay subtitle
"Too many bugs for a better rating. Sometimes the picture in picture mode won't work at all, other times it pauses. App in general is glitchy"
Take down the dance show of the little girls twerking I do not know the names that is sick and disgusting your company is about to use a lot of business because of the Black Shows or Movies that you have put in a category all in it's own and now this show!! Thinking of canceling my subscription come September 9th 2020 a long with with many many others... Do Not Air That Show!! Wrong move! For the child predators and child abusers and just gives them something watch!! Gross!
ðŸ˜šðŸ˜šðŸ˜š
Hate it. I'm getting tired of you guys pushing your latest shows. That usually have nothing to do with my viewing history.
"Got $15.99 plan. Proceeds to charge me $15.99 + $17.91? Customer service a joke. Tells me ""yea. that's just what they do"". WTH."
"Asked me to choose from 2 accounts or none of the above, they were the same account. When I chose any of the 3 options I was kicked off the app"
Hc ? .lir ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜Š
"Good service, except for the sexualisation of minors. The upcoming Cuties for example. Won't be back any time soon."
I would give a higher rating but this app frustrates me with its segregation of show and film options via geographical location. Meaning I can't watch a show because I live in a different country.... Utterly ridiculous

"Nowadays whenever i am trying to open the aap it says Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later. (-1001). This is coming from past few days please fix this otherwise ill simply stop using this aap and withdraw my account with Netflix."
I can't download it. I've tried many times already.
The app is not free oooooo
"Viewing experience is not great in pixel 3xl. The background is pitch black for older content (pre 2019-2020) & for the newer content is dark grey-ish. Auto brightness option is also a great feature, otherwise it's either too bright in dark or the details aren't great."
Periodic black screen when trying to watch things. Restarting doesn't always work
Before this i use celcom and then i change to unifi.. So my acc cannot make a payment bcs i change my number so i cannot make payment using my old celcom number... I hope netflix can add unifi number to make a payment as soon as possible.. Thank you
Why UPI and Google Pay is not accepted by netflix?? Disappointed!
The reason why i rate this 2 stars cause some shows and series seasons is not complete and removed popular movies which was my favorites they removed jumanji welcome to the jungle and spiderman homecoming why would you remove it my point is add the movies again pls or my ratings will be still 2 points
"Idk if u would reply to this or not..but just wanted to point out that I've been using netflix for months now and yesterday was the last date of my payment..and so I just wanted to resume it and while doing so it just says there was an error in the payment ?I mean like I've been using the same account for months and now it just says ""Error""..Hope u see this and reply.."
Very impressive
"I have a stable internet connection. Still says error 1001. I have restarted my phone, reinstall this app. Still i cant open netflix and use it. Its disappointing"

ðŸ˜¤
Giving two starts because the Cuties movie shouldnt be a thing.
. How about 1440p content since most flagship phones support it? Please make less garbage content and focus on more high end flashy content.
Spend is slow
Stop child p***ography
"Netflix, I know you're supporting LGBT+ and nothing is wrong about it but PEDOPHILIA IS NOT OK, PLS STOP SUPPORTING THESE CREEPS AND DO WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO"
Not entirely great value for money being $10 a month for 480p viewing.
Films are absolutely impossible to watch without having to restart the application at least 10 times during the process
Needs better scary movies
Need more options
Too many nasty immoral shows had to get VidAngel app just to watch Netflix....sad ðŸŒŽ
Expected more from this app..limited movies choice ..

Picture in picture mode doesn't work on my phone anymore and app keeps freezing.
I want new things to come or atleast old things but that are good
Not opening in my new device Motorola Nexus..... Although I am a subscriber to Netflix.
Great app but there is a few problem. 1. Subtitles keep turning on each time I leave and then come back to show 2. When going to next ep of a show that I just turned subs of then has subs back on 3. In little widow mode it does not continue to next episode 4. When paused in little widow mode it can not be continued unless I go back a little
"Put the parental pin back. I shouldn't have to lock my acc entirely just because I want a pin. I like when I selected a show that is blocked, to my pin to be there. I tried to reset the original pin that i have to something different but it won't change. I share my profile with my child and have the pin in place for him. He doesnt always only want to watch kid shows"
"Subtitles on all videos are coming in very delayed, if at all about 15% of the time. What gives Netflix?"

Buggy. The video distorts when I'm using the forward and backward buttons.
"Why I am not able to find movies which I like for example want to see the reader but not available shows different searches, no filter Available for movies and TVs shows are grouped in single , if I select a category for example only comedy movies should display but whole bunch comes out"
Losing interest in the content. I only watch The Office and some documentaries.
Audio and video delays sometimes on mobile

"Hi Netflix team, Yesterday I was watching movie *fantastic beasts and where to find them* but due to some reason I had to left in a midway. It was nice movie but today i tried to resume that movie and it was not available. You might be updating your movie library but at atleast skip those accounts who are watching movies. I would highly appreciate if you add this movie again. Thanks in advance. Thanks Bharat mehra"
wish they have latest movies
How can I register if I haven't paymenet cards I don't have any credit cards
The smart download thing is not working properly anymore. It's not even downloading or even when it does it is downloading the previous episodes
I don't know what's bthe hype for! They barely have any movie that I think of! They should improve their library...
Ugly
"This apps is not working on my phone na, the (- 14) error message shows up every time I open the app, please help."
At first it was all but one day when I went on the app and went to a movie my device was dark but nothing was wrong with my phone so please fix that
Everytime I go to watch a movie it wants to lag hard for 5 seconds then it won't play the video only the sound of the show and I have tried multiple other shows and movies and it happens with everyone but on other devices it works perfectly. Please fix it and I will give it a better review and more stars
well I can't resume the videos after I pause them. Tapping on skip is pretty annoying.
everytime i get excited about a new show it gets cancelled. makes it extremely hard to enjoy the app. makes me cautious to start shows with only season because i'm scared i'll get drawn into it just to be left hanging.
Netflix is good but all your tv shows have more seasons and you dont have them wicth get me mad so all of our animes we have to wacthing someone else platform that just my opinion tho
Same movies may1 cancel
When I open the app it keeps closing itself
It's improved a slight bit
Alwats freezes.. Even when i have full service.. Its beyond annoying
The brightness setting in the app is stupid its not bright enough and why is not synced with the phone's sensors?
Whenever I make a payment it cracks every time then I have to install it again...please make a solution
"You have to make a list of ""watched"" and separate from ""my list"", and move the titles automatically when it is watched!"
Good
Firstly it is difficult to get into the app. Everything takes long to load. I need to chat with a cc personal but no one comes on line
"After last couple of updates I keep getting this message ""There is a problem playing this video. Please try again."" The app and shows used to be soo much better. It's almost $20 a month now and I can't even watch my shows."
The app has been good bt recently i tried to sign in and keeps refusing i dont know yy......And i recently got a new phone and am trying to sign into my account bt it keeps on failing
Really difficult to login ...my kid accidentally deleted the app and now after downloading it back again I am unable to login..even on my first attemtp to login it says too many login attempt.try another time....has happened before as well...so many timw the videos would just stop playing.i am really fed up of not being able to log back in.
Pedofilos y eso pero los animes bien
Having a lot of error's and trouble upon watching episodes...fix your bugs and I will give better rate..
When you register for the app and pay for service its crashing and everytime you try to log in its crashing. Solve this issue
"AGREGUEN MAS VARIEDAD,mas lenguajes a las peliculas y series,tienen muy poca variedad y opciones,es como Televisa LO MISMO DE SIEMPRE"
M getting error as device failure services stopped i have cleared app cache and it wont reinstal i have updated it as well using Samsung a50 os is updated as well please respond asap
Y there is no kannada option in it u have tamil telugu and malayalam but not kannada come on nore than 6cr ppl speak kannada u can't do this to those ppl
Where is the pay with Google Pay?
Good
It's good but some episode can't play.
It's been frustrating. The audio of the movies keep running even after I go to my home screen.
"Good for human entertainment, but worse for nature."
Whenever I click the search button it goes back to homepage
Netflix Should Add some Tv Shows Like the Flash We dont Care About liscensing Cause We re In A globale Pandemic And Other Apps Have All the americans Movies So try To Do Like them
we want âœ¨animeâœ¨
App keeps on crashing when you subscribe through app. Not able to login since i have bought a subscription. Only after uninstalling and then installing again it worked.
"Unable to make payment monthly subscription, customer care centre also could not help despite os spending 1 hr. Repeatedly trying to renew. I would like to watch more Netflix ðŸ˜­"
Has been really glitchy lately Edit 2 months later...still super glitchy
I like the app but I refuse to watch anymore original series. They don't last past 1 or 2 seasons and they have no regaurd for ending them properly for the fans of the show. Why waste my time watching 10 episodes wanting to see what happens next and never finding out.
I hate that I can't adjust my screen brightness while watching Netflix. I also can't figure out how to turn off the apps permission to do so.
Good but was pausing all the time
Netflix how dare you. Please dont cancel the society season 2 for that im gonna change my rate for 2stars. Explain thisðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
"Once I've updated my latest android, the apps won't work well. I can't watch any movies using wifi and have to use my own mobile data. Even using mobile data it won't work well. Sometimes even the image didn't appear at all. I've done restarted, re-installed but it's still the same. pls fix."
"I remember in the 90's and early 00's we would go to a video shop to rent videos for the weekend. They had the 'New Release' section and the 'Weekleys' section. Netflix just replicates the Weekleys section, mostly old junk. I want a subscription service which replicates the 'New Release' section. Too many foreign language films. You need to add better search tools."
put more movies please and also kids movies.
Good STOP TRYING TO PUT A CHILD PORNO ON NETFLIX
I COULD NOT LOG IN
It wont let me log into the app i tried everything and it just wont let me log in
"Its okay I guess, I only have it for Its always sunny in Philadelphia, anyway the miniplayer thing doesn't work and its annoying as hell, pls fix, also stop normalising Pedophilia"
"The programming looks more for a person from India than from USA, too many Indian and Oriental. And too much repetition of movies and series, not too much variety. Also too many OLD movies. Not worth the price like before, also there are plenty new applications and free websites to watch the same or better."
"As opÃ§Ãµes sÃ£o muito, mas muito restritas. PorÃ©m o que mais me chateia sÃ£o as legendas horrorosas. As traduÃ§Ãµes extremamente preguiÃ§osas, num ponto de que qualquer mudanÃ§a de idioma nos filmes, fica sem legenda. E nÃ£o Ã©, sei lÃ¡, uma mudanÃ§a pro coreano. Qualquer mudanÃ§a mesmo. Tipo portuguÃªs/espanhol, inglÃªs/espanhol. Isso tira muito do qualidade dos filmes e mostra um serviÃ§o de baixa qualidade."
Works every time on my TV. But hardly ever on my mobile phone. Not sure why.
"Why isn't there a comment section for a TV Series? I was greeted with "" thumbs up and down' like most hypocrite politicians do..... Is NETFLIX all about greed ""FOR"" money or greed of ""MONEY""?!?!"
Bad streaming.. Very slow
Just paid for my subscription and updated my Netflix app .. Yet it doesn't want to open. When I click to open it it just closes. I'm quite annoyed.
Trouble connecting or other errors persist even after reinstalling. No realiable solution yet.
Most films are very old. Some TV series are good though.
I don't not able to login
"It keeps showing me error 3.1 n I've followed the instructions a gazillion times, changed my device but it stays same"
Good
"Whenever I restart my membership, the app starts misbehaving."
"On the registration part, you can add other mode of payment for subscription, for those people who dont have credit or debit card, and doesnt subscribe to any postpaid account."
Good
I just bought netflix and im kinda dissapointed becausd most of the anime doesnt have a compelete season or episodes but hey just keep releasing new anime without finishing the others
"I own a samsung galaxy s7 (SM-G930F), and even though the phone is Widevine L1 certified, netflix has listed the model as L3 certified and I cannot stream the content in HD. Please look into this and list the model in HD compatible devices."
Why cant log in beacause my email is perfact apps is dumb and i have to pay no way i just want watch movie trash
"Honestly speaking Netflix is good app, u can watch movies and series with low data consumption but the most important problem i found in Netflix is u cannot see everything on Netflix. No. of movies series are missing we can't see them on Netflix other apps like popcorn provides almost everything that too for free. I thought being a paid app Netflix must be providing everything but i quite disappointed as i can't watch most of my fav movies and series on Netflix. Please fix this problem ASAP...!!"
Okey
Osm app learning money
"Sometimes the app don't open well, it shows a pop up message that there is a device failure and have to restart the app and after one restart the app works completely fine."
Average
I had fun but I need my hero academia season 4 I had requested for season 4 but it didn't came on netflix then I will give it full star .
"Not working, service error"
Add more anime series
Needs to update new movies more often
"Never anything new. Everything is about rape, murder, horror."
I don't know what happen but previous it is working nice but now suddenly this app is not opening .please Netflix fix this issue #netflix
After removing the option to pay with Google play I won't be using Netflix anymore update this and I may use it again sorry.
II HATE U!!!!!
The sexualization of children is too far
No quentin tarantino films :(
Netflix needs new movies weekly
Not worth the money and some pretty weird messed up tv shows eg one is about A 11 YEAR OLD JOINING A DANCE CREW TO TWERK whole show is about it pretty messed up
"Why there is no episode download option for Android TV? It's so annoying to watch an episode in poor quality because of peak hour! Could you please port this option into Android TV app? And increase the buffer, so when l pause it fills. I don't know why l am paying for HD when l get less than SD :/ Please give us some more options - not all users are amoeba..."
ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®
Perfect
Add beyblayed burst gt and beyblayed burst sparking NOW!!!
Need malay subtitle pls
"Not able to log in,showing not able to contact"
Having a lot of trouble having it on my phonenI have to delete it and re install every other day
Why is this showing an error code which doesn't allow me to open the app.
This is a very good app
"Error terus pas nonton. Padahal sinyal bagus pas streaming tp tetep aja suka error. Terlebih lg kalo download. Aneh film yg didownload bisa error, itu knapa ya?"
"It's just full of foreign movies and series but the subtitles never match the words being spoken, who the hell writes these things?? ðŸ˜‚"
I can't open my netflix since 2 days ago
Intetoslow
"Honestly its got great shows and movies,but if i try to pay it hangs and stops ,thats why i hate it and when i put the ccv from my card it does the same thing.i hate that"
"Okay, I just figured out a bug for you. You are welcome! When you register through the app and pay for service through the app, then login, it crashes and keeps crashing very time you launch it. I managed to find a workaround by deleting the app data and logging in with an already existing account. At least it works now, so I'm changing from 1 star to 2. What a wonderful greeting for new subscribers!"
It's just crash at startup on my Samsung A50..some time not every time....always need a restart....that's for star
Because only debit card not Paytm and phonepay
Netflix app keep on crashing
Please don't remove Full House... Its the best... Pls...
Searching could work on that a lityle more
Take dislike movie out from suggestions. When I dislike a movie why it comes again on the viewing suggestions. It very irritating.
It makes me happy everyday ðŸ˜Šâ™¥ï¸
Nice app
"Unbelievable. I paid for subscription which I seldom use and when I do, I can't even watch smoothly. I've downloaded the episodes so I won't use too much battery when online and most importantly to avoid buffering which blurs out the video. But why and why does the episode still need to load for forever and the actual app crash every time? ðŸ˜¤ It won't matter if you have more shows than other apps if you don't have good service."
"It's difficult to watch random movie, sometimes it's available most of time not. If we want to watch, we have to request and wait for max 15 days that's ruins our furious mood. Second Netflix don't allow user reviews on Movies. And that waste my times many times, because Netflix always highlight every movie as premium. Despite these two major problem I love this plateform. Because Netflix provide best video streaming, very less lag in slow network speed also."
It seems like they got rid of all the good movies and just show you their not so great Netflix originals.
"There are very few new A List/Box Office, hit movies."
Kept on login me out
Some Anime are not dubbed so it ruins my expectations ðŸ˜’
"So the ""Random Episode"" button has been gone for about a year now and I still haven't heard anything from Netflix about it even having existed. Why was the button added and removed in such a short period? Why was it removed at all?"
After forwarding a minute the audio is lagging by a long gap. It is impossible to watch a video after forwarding it in the app...this is happening only in the app and is fine in the web version
Its a good app but keeps stopping all time
"Taking long time to start on my Redmi Note 7 Pro, please do something"
"Please check my profile. I'm unable to download. It says I'm logged into some other device, which I'm not. There is a new issue coming every now and then and I gotta post it here to get it sorted out. Wth"
Can not cast play on tv
Black screen even though you already updated it. Need to re-install again. So much hassle.
X I xx nnh c can Nj z we are bvy
Add more payment methods
Why doesn't the new version support multi-tasking anymore (split screen)? Why take away a good function? Just weird.....
"There should be more options for paying, like UPI or RuPay card etc."
after updating app not opening
There should be an optio to stop autorenewal
Its undoubtedly a fantastic app to see films but they charge 16â‚¬ per month and that I find too expensive
Netflix requires way too many permissions to personal and unrelated information. The Google play Netflix app has too many bug issues and has very weak data security. Other then that Netflix is alright.
its always saying something went wrong when I try to make an account
I dont have any idea about netflex.it was my first time to have this app on my mobile phone.thats why i give only 2 stars for my reviews.
2s
"It worked for a while but then it started saying things like ""this video is not available to stream immediately"", it said things like this before but this time no matter how much I tried none of the shows worked, i decided to uninstall and install it again but this just made everything worse, now every time I open it it tells me to log in and whenever i log in the app crashes. Please fix this or i won't be able to watch anything anymore"
"Haven't made use of it, but I sure hope it'd be nice."
"I hate that in the US there is more than 3000 things to watch and in my location(Israel) you dont have access to this content... Do I really need to pay another app (VPN) to be able to watch content that is hidden from me? Also in the US and in IL we pay exacly the same price, so that's really annoying me. I'm considering moving to another stream business."
Can't pay again
"The app asks me who's watching every time I open it even though there's only 1 profile. No, this is not a feature."
"i like this app but for a long time when i watch a series the screen is full black, i just can hear the voices but there is no image..."
Can you give the option to hide movies. There are some that I really don't want to watch and they always come up.
"It's a good app, but why do I keep getting errors when I try to open it most of the time? I have to uninstall the app multiple times for it to work properly and even stil, after a few episodes of anything, it does it all over again If I'm paying for a service, why do I have to deal with errors popping up? Please fix this I really enjoy it when it works properly"
SD resolution is very bad. HD plans are expensive in India compared to other streaming platforms.
There is a problem with my Netflix. I deleted it and now I'm not able to sign in again. 2 IDs come after clicking none of the above I'm back on my home screen again.. It's super irritating ðŸ™
"Horrible gay characters and horrible teen ""comedy"" series"
Not a lot of movie choices I prefer disney plus couldn't find a lot of good movies and t e only disney movie o found i think was tinker bell wich may be good to a 7 year old.
"Recently I have not been able to open Netflix on my phone .message I get : "" sorry, we could not reach Netflix service"" . Restarted, updated and reinstalled multiple times. Works just fine on the computer. Netflix support , please address this issue !"
Continually crashes
"The app just keeps crashing even when in the background. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a number of times but still doesn't work. Fix this issue, please it's getting frustrating. Aside this, everything else is fine."

"Hi there! I don't know why, but after a recent update I can't use my headphones anymore, I mean they don't work only with Netflix. When it comes to other apps - it's ok. But not with Netflix, there's just no sound at all. Mi A3."
Everytime I'm watching a show it keep freezing .
Doesn't remember where I am if I switch from watching on my TV to my mobile and vice versa.
"Your subscription package is too high and not a value for money. Try to come up with value packs. Learn from Amazon, they offer 1year subcription with multiple device uasge for just 999/-. You cannot survive more time in this ott if u keep this continuing.."
I tried to open the app after new subscription. Also tried to open from mail. Doesn't open. It is freezing. Also updated. But no luck. Please help as soon as possible.
I really wish this app or better. Its a disorganized mess and there seems to be no way to tell Netflix not to show to all the programs I dont want to watch. This is like digging through the sale at Hot Topic.
Since latest download the program just continues to load and doesn't work properly.
"I didn't expect this. It says max playback resolution SD and L3 certified, although my device is L1 and supported fullHD playback on Netflix a day before. What is this??? Please help. I think there's device registration issue or a bug. I'm using Realme6 pro"
"I cant download any series, movies etc. What happen to this update? Its all crashedðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ not worth paying for. Please fix this"
"its not complete movies , like conjuring only part 1 and dont have the nun .."
"I re-downloaded it, and it won't open up again and it'll keep on saying close app or netflix isn't responding, and it's so frustating, and when it works before and then it doesn't again!!"
Netflix app is not starting up after I made a payment for renewal. It is automatically shutting down.
"uhm why is your beta program full , when will it be ready it keeps jumping out of Netflix i don't know what to do just please fix it . When I go in it jumpes out and then shows which account to choose from."
Cant recharge give other options to subscribe it google pay etc.icant do payment while its telling this card is not acceptable give update
Not good
Mostly junk these days. I'm about done. I keep holding out for netflix to be good again...it's not happening. Nothing good anymore...just a bunch of netflix originals....they keep taking good shows and movies off and don'y add any
Most shows that I liked are not here such as Young justice or spongebob. I keep on trying to get into the beta program yet its full and the app won't update ever.

"We need a feature to lock the screen. We need a button that can control video speed. We should be able to control the volume and brightness by scrolling up or down on the screen. There should be more choices language subtitles We should be able to go higher than 1080p or choose screen resolution, if one's phone/computer allows that. For example, my computer can go 4k. PLEASE HAVE A SPEED UP BUTTON, SOME SHOWS I CANNOT STAND 1.0X SPEED. WE PAY alot of money for this. Please give more features."
Some shows are okay. Videos are incredibly grainy. Too many dothead movies and tv shows that suddenly appeared on Netflix for no reason.
Have on TV but at the good times there's no sound. And no my sound on the TV isn't on mute. ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜

Osm
Too costly
"I don't understand what is going on with Netflix, I've had Netflix for a couple of years and now I have to constantly reset, and then it won't work"
Suddenly netflix stops working even this app is not working by still updating it !!! Please check and updateðŸ˜£
Mario Race Way. I love you Mommy The first time

Porque si
I like Netflix but the msg me constantly and it's a pain in the a$$ when they do.
I updated Netflix today and my series has just frozen! I went out of the app and back in again and it's still frozen. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still I can't get it to open. I never had any problems with the previous version of the app. How do I get that version back??? I'm so frustrated!!!
its been waiting for download for an hour now
"This app.. my God, just sticks for no reason. Constantly need to exit the app, close it and reopen it to get it working again."
Netflix becomes buggy after the new update. The app closes multiple times while in the middle of watching a movie. Please fix this bug.
Price
I am having issues with the app not working on my PHONES. It doesn't open and says NETFLIX IS NOT RESPONDING. I'm not sure why it's only the phone app cuz I have it on other systems and it works fine.
Fun movies
"Brightness control is terrible, lowers maximum brightness the phone is capable of. Give option to turn in app brightness control off."
Can't adjust to save movies to SD card anymore. Even the help files to show how to do this are outdated and show the options that no longer exist.
"I want to save data with watching stuffs here but I doesn't adjust, still maximum"
keep experiencing decvce failure
I have to keep re -installing the app. Cause it doesn't open .
"I like every thing but there should be a feature to control stream quality like YouTube, this 2 star is for the app. The shows are mind-blowing."
I cannot open the app
The latest update is faulty. Can't play a downloaded video after renewing it.
Ay...had better
Pls add Harry potter to Italy
Great app love it and I use it every day. There is one problem that surfaced recently and that has been bothering me. The picture in picture mode doesn't work. It creates the pic but it is paused. I use this feature often and it is very annoying. If this is fixed it will be a 5 star.
The minimize on screen no longer plays and this really sucks. I canceled my hulu subscription because it did not allow me to work and watch my shows on my Samsung Note at the same time. Hope they can fix this!
"Good selection. Minus three stars for blocking split screen, pop-up view, and picture in picture features."
"Wonderful app ,help me to know more movies related to english.."
Picture freezes on show but sound keeps playing
"I use Netflix app in my tab, coming soon section is missing, it's very annoying"
It takes forever to download. It freezes.. It's not my Wi-Fi cause everything else works fine.
Add the fourth season of My Hero Academia
"I can no longer watch Netflix on my phone as it's TOO BRIGHT!! The dimmer bar on the left does nothing to resolve the problem. The brightness is blinding in low light making it impossible to watch. By making it a mandatory feature Netflix is assuming everyone wanted this feature. That really stinks, Netflix. You could have made it an option. By making this assumption, Netflix, your decreasing my viewing option giving me less incentive to keep paying for your service."
Unable to open Netflix. Keep getting same error whenever I try to login. (501.-116) (-1001)
"Used to work great, I just reinstalled and it won't open...too bad"
Cannot enter any account and just kicks me out wennever I want
Please Also Add Speed Control 1.10X For Boring Shows Bcause We are Not Native English Speakers But 1.10X Is fine for us. MX player is good on that.
Iam not able to access Netflix and getting this error repeatedly. Sorry we could not reach the netflix service.Please try again later(-1001)
App has removed full hd playback support for my device while it was working before..call it a degrade not updateðŸ˜
I have to disable and re-enable the app EVERY time I click on it. Frustrating.
The app is very good and .And u need to bring out more .And it takes T Ll W
I had this app before but I deleted awhile ago and now every time I try to log into my account it goes to home screen over and over again please fix
"Lots of scenes are cut in many of the tv series and movies, why do they have to follow the censor board. It makes it bad and difficult to understand few scenes. It was never this way before. I'm looking to cancel my subscription because of this!"
Watching all kinds of different shows
Please update your anime series. Other sites have their latest episodes and yet you are stuck with old episodes. Such a failure for a streaming app.
Autoplay gets more obnoxious as time goes by
"When I watch it on my phone, the video freezes but the sound keeps playing. Plesse fix this"
Since last update it is not allowing me to open the application.
"Updated netflix , lipsync in the video is going all wrong, putting speed zone is the worst update ever"
Its not working on my Redmi Note 9 as I have tried all methods provided on website. Kindly fix this issue. I'm really worried about it.
Such pathetic suggestions!!! Please stop pushing your own content. Suggest content based on what an individual likes to watch. Isn't that common sense? ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸
Good at movies
Keeps crashing. Uninstalled and now installing again. Not happy so far.
Why does it take so long to download a movie. Internet stream is high and device storage is 64 GB
"Bad app ,because cut amount without my permision"

App is not operating keeps closing it self
Nah if it had Disney on there than okay
"I have problem with my account because when i want to watch it, it just loads for hours. Sometimes it even never loads the episode. Before this, i have no problem watch any shows but now, I had to uninstall then install the app again, clear cache and even try downloading the episode and have it watch offline but still no result. Can you figure it out please?"
There is no arabic series movis
"Ripped off due to didnt get play points from game i spent over $1,000 on"
Lot of problems with the payment method.. and there is no solution to it as yet.. which is very annoying
Raise my bill 1 more cent and hiring communist people and ill take my business elsewhere

Cable theek karo
Amazing movie
I already downloaded the movie to my phone to Chromecast it to my Smart TV but STILL Netflix connect to my wifi AND STILL EATS UP DATA FROM WIFI. How can this be happenings? Bad user experience when casting because of double data consumption.
Payment updation is worst
"Honestly netflix has way to many c rated and bootleg movies theres is not a great selection the worst genre to watch on netflix is either horror, comedy, or romance the barely care about the kid selection i am aware the added the last avatar and the legend of korra to the kids list BUT my recommendation is to add movies people are gonna watch like hobbs and shaw or joker you add movies no one cares nor knows about netflix is a money waster just go to hulu"
It's not letting me in
Why are half the shows and movies suddenly missing from my Netflix?
Wont load. Keeps closing out on me
"You broke multitasking on my G8X dual screen, If I use my second screen at all your app pauses now. This was a huge benefit before the latest version."
Dismal
I keep unstalling this App because it always say error..
The reason why two stars because I can't the find the movie that I want to watch that Netflix used to have
"I would normally rate Netflix a 5... but one major issue brings it waaay down. The play button doesn't work! Thats right, when you pause it, the play button won't work to resume the show! This is brand new in this update, so Netflix? Do a better job with your beta program. No reason this bug should get into the mainstream release!"
It didn't keep my kids occupied
"You get more expensive but your content gets worse! Have you run so low on shows and movies that you have to fill my selection with stuff that isn't even my language?! Never anything new but your ""Netflix originals"" Just download KODI on your phone and cast to a Google chrome cast and YouTube has videos on how to program it. Brand new movies for free!"
"The app does not want to open anymore, if I tap on it, it shows the netflix sign, but then kicks me out and closes. Please help..."
"I pay for this service and I'm angry that the search engine is complete garbage in this app. On my phone and my tablet I am unable to find movies when i specifically search for the title, yet I am able to access them in results when i search from an internet browser. Fix your damn search engine problems. I feel like you've trapped me in a limited algorithm and are refusing to show me other things I search for. My tablet version of the app is worse. You only show same 50 titles in my searches."
Please fix brightness settings. Galaxy s10 (had this issue on the s8 also) cannot control my own brightness because app takes control and it's too dark to see! Can't use the app until it is fixed
"The app is ok, does what it needs to do. The genre classification is really bad, there are dramas in the comedy genre, the same movie is shown 3 times with different thumbnail to appear as there are more movies, suggestions always focus on Netflix productions, not based on my preferences. There are movies like Sherk 4 and 5 but there is no 1 and 2. So a lot of room for improvement."
There's no good movies on this app
Keeps crashing and won't load films. I have had to uninstall 3 times and I am about to reinstall again. I hope it works this time otherwise I will cancel my subscription
It won't download or I can't stop from downloading
Keep getting error messages
Search results should be improved. Currently it's showing unrelavant search results.
Updated! Keeps crashing while watching. Please fix this asap. #Galaxy Note 8
"I keep getting an error code saying that it can't reach the Netflix service. I don't know why it's started to do that. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but nothing works. Please fix this problem. I'm dying of boredom here."
Not good nor bad
"I face problem whenever I open the app, took the membership and i am wasting my money"
"While I am a big fan of Netflix, I am so disappointed with this app. I tend to listen to shows I've enjoyed watching before while riding my bike, but Netflix appwill not continue running if I shut the screen off to put the phone in my pocket. You cannot just start something and assume that it will keep running once you hit play.It's just very frustrating and absolutely not a hands-free experience. In fact it takes up so much of your time trying to fix it and get it to work again after you've"
"Constant problems connecting to devices, will disconnect and not be able to control the show, just because the phone goes to sleep while watching 30 minutes of your movie/show. Maybe it's good for watching shows on the go on the phone itself, but this was not my intended use."
Update: what happened to multi-tasking? Why can't I watch a video on split screen while using another app?
"I can't get into the apps at all, please fix it. Also, i hope there is a setting for kids under 13 only because my younger brother is not below 7 anymore and when i set to 7 years and below, he doesn't like the movies. But if i turned off the age restriction, sometimes he can see the inapropriate movie covers for adult. I hope you can take this matter into account. Thank you."
I gave two stars because there are no full seasons of the amazing world of gumball
"Lose widevine l1 req't for hd. looks vile and is disrespectful to creators and watchers. better quality if I play shows on a computer at home miles away and remote into it. otherwise however, stellar controls and design language. really socks it to hulu"
Netflix use to play on split screen and dual screen while i scrolled on whatever now it goes on pause if the other screen is touched on dual screen and it doesn' t do split screen at all.
I don't know why some time this app is not getting open for me even though I already reported about this en number of times... Soo kindly resolve this issue in next update.. Because after subscription these type of issue causes means it will not make a good opinion about Netflix... Even now also I can't able to open this app. That's wat the reason now I am giving these kind of review... Other than this the app is suprbb... Vera level...
Historical movies not available on Netflix
Just get stuck loading... Can't watch anything and I'm connected to WiFi. Plz fix
After using Netflix on my phone it stops working and there are no updates. Why does netflix stop working
It's very bad for me
"It doesn't have movies which have launched years back. Very dissapointed at the minimal choice of movies. Movies like conjuring 2 is practically free to watch at many You tube site, but here it's not there. Whole 5 Parts of Insidious chapter 1,2,3,4,5 is available everywhere, even at You Tube sites. Charges per month ridiculous high amount of money!!!! It's a serious issue, the money you are charging unjustifiable for the B grade movies you are giving me to watch!!"
My screen is stuck on the starting page
Video is not playing only audio is playing
"error 5.7 is too prominent in the last few days. Its really annoying and cant get out of it. Netflix, please fix this asap"
Where has split screen support gone?! Please fix this
When I am open this app it is showing 500 error Its irritating that showing this error again and agin.
"Since the last update the app shuts down automatically, it does not even allow me to select anything, it keeps on shutting down after every few seconds. Please look after the matter."
App is charging money that is too expensive and not easy to buy plans or subscription for a average person and main thing is plan is per month and if it is possible it would b less
You need you add more moves everyweek or something horror my fav but iwstch others as well so I rate you 2 stars
The beta data is full already and i don't even use this ap much. I may have used it 3 times since i downloaded it and now i cant even update it.
Not working on android TV cant find the app in play store
"Fix the split screening, now when I split screen the app it pauses playback as soon as I tap another app."
"Keep saying ""Netflix has stopped"" everytime I open the app. Please fix the issue asap."
You worry about giving us an honest changelog and I'll worry about giving a real review afterwards.
Why is US Netflix different from the others? It's either you give us all the same good shows or give us a discount. Because Starz play and Amazon Prime are cheaper and better and I'm thinking of canceling my subscription the same way you keep canceling good shows like 'Dead to Me'..
Busines practice are becoming somewhat shady. You end up having to pay for more service to unlock your account in order for them to make adjustments to things that were their fault. .
Every day theirs an somekind of error coming up..2.2 or etc..
"Normally i would've given it 4 stars, but since yesterday it had been acting up and I cant watch use the app if my phone, it keeps crashing. I tried restarting my phone and uninstalling the app but each time it was the same. I left it until today and now i am going to try it"
"I wouldve gaven ir a 4 or 5 star review but the fact that i cant even watch my series/films peacefully without it constantly stopping and making the screen go all black, and also losing its sound. I have filed a repor6 but yet still did nothing i cannot re-install it because i have forgotton my password and my email isnt valid anymore or not useable. Please fix this problem im very annoyed"

Sacaron Friends.
Why i get a netflix error 1001..?
Why some movies only for some countries ?
Less movies to watch
I added my credit card...it's auto debited every month but on login it again asks for money
the coolest options in Netflix is it remembers where i left but now its not working
"Was a good app, but now isn't working on Android 10.0 won't connect to the server. Needs to be fix before I rate it any higher"
Offline video's are not playing properly
Its crashing two times and some movies are not plaing
the first
"i dont know what happened but i uninstalled and reinstalled it once and now it wont work right..it just keeps saying error reaching netflix services,ive tried to restart my phone and everything else is working just fine except for this app."
I have just resumed my membership for one month and the app just don't start up. Money has been deducted and now it's showing issues in opening. Upgraded the app aswell but no use..please help to fix this..
It doesn't open at all :/
Sad excuse for adding content and auto applying subtitles. Not making it better by this method. JUST SAD. A daily update for what? And hard to find data rate options. How is this a free app? You must pay to view content.
Subtitles on by default again!!! Cannot search by genre! Searching anything only shows what is in my list. Will not recognize password after last update.
"It was working properly before but after this latest update, it started lagging on my phone. Watching movies is now so frustrating"
T spare a moment and just register at the same time and I will be able to get the rest of the
"Normally, it's great... the last week is so, it's been acting up. Everytime I resume a show or movie, it starts back at the beginning. It's getting really annoying!"
Netflix bakwas
"Has its flaws, but several that I had complained about were fixed, earning back 2 stars for total of 4, as there's room for improvement yet it's decent. Edit: evidently there's also always room for detriment, they scared away the creators of Avatar the last Airbender from the production of the live Avatar series. This is quite unforgivable, given the history. 2 stars are retained, as they could screw up further."
No marvel shows not even captain America Cmon netflix
Giving error no. 1023 continuously in my new phone Samsung Galaxy A 31 and cannot open. Have to uninstall and reopen everytime.
"WHY YOU DON'T LET US TO SCREENSHOT OH NETFLIX PLSðŸ˜­ I JUST WANT TO MAKE A SCREENSHOT SO I CAN MAKE THEM INTO WALLPAPER BUT WHY YOU ARE SO CRUELðŸ˜­ CAN'T YOU PLS MAKE US HAPPY EVEN FOR A WHILE, NETFLIX?ðŸ˜­"
"The app is good, but you always delete shows. People will be in the middle of the show then suddenly it is deleted. Please stop deleting. Also from yesterday the app doesn't allow me to log in. In only shows the black Netflix screen and then kicks me out. I have rebooted my phone as well as deleted and reinstalled the app. Please assist"
The app shuts itself down as soon as I click on the email please fix that
I used to have Netflix and was a good app. For personal reasons i left it for a few months. Now im back and i cant do gender guided search! Stupid app!
Not alot of good shows
"As much as I love Netflix, they took off a LOT of the stuff I watched on there. Especially when it came to movies and shows like Law and Order SVU, I moved to Hulu and man they got ever season and every episode and they have a lot more stuff to watch than Netflix tbh. The only thing I really use Netflix for is their old entertainment that's been there for as long as I could remember (mainly anime and old movies)."
You can't add your own picture to your profile.

Expensive
Can't download movies or tv shows
I've downloaded it multiple times on my phone and every time I click on it it crashes and take me back to my home screen. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not one is because I've used Netflix on tvs and loved it. So it's got a low rating cause the mobile app doesn't work.
Downloaded movies to watch in off line while watching movie screen is glitching....tried closing and reopening the app but didn't worked....now my main screen is showing glitches... Restarted the phone to solve my phone's screen issue...but inside the app downloaded movie have same problem
"OK, movies and shows great but the app is so buggy have to restart my phone for it to work. The screen goes black and only sound plays."
Boring content.

Why why why !!! Why did you change the play screen with the play and download buttons the earlier thumbnail was very good. Why this change ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£
Cant watch on my dual screen anymore without the app pausing if i touch the other screen. On Lg v60 dual screen
"Instead of giving a single payment method, introduce gift cards in india which is an better alternative for unsupported debit cards. Netflix is only for rich guys!"
Add hindi audio in all movies and web series
I can't open my Netflix. It's showing sign in with account that has Google smart lock. The app isn't running at all
Keep on having error which makes it very incovenient! I had to uninstall a few uncountable times!
Whenever i open this app always there is a error code icon appearing.app is updated always then also. Why ??????
Why i can't sign up.. Can't pay
"After restarting the app, movie resume does not work. Movie restarts from the beginning."
The play speed was gone after updating. P.ease fix this
Terrible ui and search engine. The lack of a good search engine wth filters and being able to browsw the library makes it hard to find stuff

WHERE IS TOKYO GHOUL! And where is Magi and why is My Hero Academy on NETFLIX !?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

I dont know what's going on but my Netflix is glitchy and it jus turns plain black not letting me watch the movie or show and it's annoying and it's also slow and laggy
Something happened to your app? Can't resume playback from the point I last watched. Everytime I press resume the whole show simply starts from the beginning! Pls fix that Netflix!
Good
Can't watch on phone no more won't load up can any1 help plz can watch on TV still
New update will not allow Netflix to play when the app is minimalized. This is a problem for those like me that like to do multiple things at once on their phone. How can this be resolved?
not many movies
"since the aug 4th update I've been unable to use the app, I would appreciate it if you could fix that"
Ex TSA
"The latest update of this app is beyond horrible. App doesn't stream any video, just keeps loading, even when internet is working well. This has been happening since the last 3 days. Hopefully, this is a temporary bug, and this will be considered before renewing the next subscription."
"On pc you can watch with good quality but on Android is almost a joke. It looks like 480p even when downloading with the ""highest"" quality. Why am I paying for the best quality?"
This app does not show all the options
I'm not able to watch on my device now for some reason and it's totally updated
Unable to subscribe by RuPay card or upi. Netflix is operating in india without Collaboration with Indian company. Total shame
Your app keeps crashing on launch:(
Netflix is becoming extremely overrated. Their BIG update recently was a joke. When am I gonna b able 2 the walking dead from like the last year? Supernatural? ANY SHOW? Can I get a useful update? If so WHEN??? So tired of waiting YEARS for a half season update. They never have anything recent except a handful of movies I think it's almost time to just move on. All other streaming services stay recent with weekly refreshes on their shows because their show have NEW EPISODES WEEKLY! Slackers!
Since last update PiP not working properly on mobile (android). Multiple glitches are visible post update. Problem in UI. PiP closes at the end of episode. I would prefer the next episode to beging without me having to open netflix and start the next one manually.
Im recharged nt able to open
It's not that much level type app. So many defult have in this
I think you have to add more payment methods
There is a glitch that makes the movie stop But overall it is a good app to watch movies and tv shows
Nic
"Crashes after crashes. I get the device failure thing 4/5 times. I literally turn on the app 5 times to get it to work once. It wouldn't play full hd on my s10 and had to reinstall to get it to work. I love the service, but the app is hot garbage."
I was paid nd watch so that not like yet
Please provide more movies and animated series like PokÃ©mon and others and please provide all languages movies it will not show any movies when I searched
Not recommended
"My show keeps disappearing of the app, I will watch like 5 episodes and then go to a different app for like 5 minutes, and my show will be gone when I'm back"
The audio and video go out of sync when fast forwarded. This is happening only after the latest update. Please correct this as soon as possible. There are no other issues with the app.
I am unable to open my Netflix app it showing me error code
Some series are not completed...
Now always pop out error cannot play videos at all. Pls fix it.
This app is good but uses lot of internet this sucks!
Not happy ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ at all u guys need to secure our account better my account got hacked by someone in Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·.

I phoned in to stop payment and cancel my Netflix subscription. Got new email address.ect what headache. I hope you can fix this problem. ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦
Pretty good but I could not log in
"Image freezes on screen, but audio continues to play"
"Usually great but on mobile its been buggy for more than a few weeks, the audio is fine but the screen is solid grey. Would love to have the convenience of watching on my phone again thanks !"
im watching netflix on my mobile and everytime i paused for more than 2mins it will get error that me ending up restarting my app or phone EVERY TIME. PLEASE FIX IT. IT'S TOO ANNOYING when you're paid and does not get the best of it
not good enough.....some movies are not there
The movies available in asia are very limited compare to netflix in australia
It's okay I prefer YouTube Netflix isn't that great
It keeps loading while the movie plays
"Every 2-3 days , this app gives me error , everytime i nees to uninstall it and then download it again.. Please check."
Tired of foriegn films being shoved in my face. This company is in the U.S where is the content they claim to have. If i do search it shows the same 75 or so shows and movies! I also am tired of kid features...no kids are on my account!
"Nowadays app is having lots of glitches, currently watching many times start from beginning, watched content shows half watched, never seen show reappear"
Its trash
Not all shows are as good as trailers look.
"if this was a free app, could have let the error messages slide. it kept asking me to restart my device after a few minutes."
Not working on my redmi note 8 pro
Please bring back the playback speed option
"I have downloaded the app , but it's showing that it needs to be restarted. I hv reinstalled it 2 times and restarted the phone several times. So please help me out with it."
It's good and all but it keeps crashing i don't know whyyy.
Very costly
Unable open
Very brilliant
Stop uploading Hinduphobic content
Not enough cartoon they have
Not good
very good app
The morality of this company has really gone down the toilet. Not to mention that all of the good tv shows/movies are being replaced by Netflix originals that are not very good...
"What happened to all of the anime,my list was full of anime,is it because I live in south africa, rights to all the anime was removed if so then that's not inconvenient but disappointing to say the least"
"Good app for movies, bad for your money. It doesn't allow us to cancel the subscription. Had to cancel my card and get a replacement card. Their customer service department is very bad, and they don't care if you have a problem. The guy i spoke to was desperate to disconnect the call and get back to something he was doing."
They removed Full House for Australia so they get a bad review :>
"Prices have gone down and quality too. It'd be highly respectable if Netflix don't jump into mainstream for money now. We have messy Bollywood movies for that, we need quality content and great actors that are not seen in mainstream here. We don't pay for mainstream media to Netflix and other similar services."
Fake App and useless
Wal di ako makascreenshot hmp
its ok
"Hi i cant seem to open the app after the upgrade. What happened? It kept telling me ""Sorry we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later."" Why? Pls help."
I am beginning to get very disappointed in this app. I pay for the biggest package a month every month. Been a loyal customer for well over a year an now you keep recommending movies to me that arent in English. I have no idea why you keep recommending movies i cannot understand. Series are not up to date. Also add on live tv channels based on viewing area so we can watch the news an weather. I dont mind paying an extra 2 or 3 bucks for live local channels based on viewing areas.
It wont let me make an accountðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
Zu wenige animes leider
Monthy price is high
"There are a few things that are wrong. I tried to watch season 7 of Naruto and it wont let me, saying something like ""show is not avalible at the moment, try again later"" That has happend 3 weeks in a row. Also it does the same with other shows, we had people out here, our internet is fine. ALSO im paying for this for NO reason, i bought it so i could watch Naruto, other anime, and to see if there was the movie Twilight. Nothing really works on this app. I've tried everything. Please fix it!"
Add k-on and other stuff to UK netflix
Some errors on my device I don't know why the app closes
"Keeps saying connection issue, I have a good connection. Also, reinstalled it and says it has an issue."
"1.36 am 9th August turned of in the middle of a series on the tv, tv says connected to internet, I turned everything of and unplugged my internet last night , today I have to log back in to netflix on the t.v.? Network server 1 tick,netflix server 2,3 nw 4-8, I have a an app who steals your wifi and it's says failed to load native ad:0 can anyone advise plz ?"
Pic in pic does not work on note 10 plus. When I try to watch with the small screen whilst doing something else it freezes. This seems to be a problem on Samsung phones
It won't load? I have a pretty new-ish phone but it's just stuck on the loading screen?!
Alot of issues with the recent updates. Video is not showing in app only audio updates.
So this app used to be 5 stars and worked great but a couple of months ago everytime I use it the screen goes almost completely dark anytime i play a show or movie regardless of how high my screen brightness is turned up. The only way I can watch netflix on my phone now is when its pitch black around me and then I can see what I'm watching. Pretty disappointed because I use my phone to watch shows all the time.
Pain on note 10 plus. I need to forse stop the app each time I want to use it as it never loads just the same error message been a few months now
The app doesn't support 120hz refresh yet... Please solve it
Too many foreign movie's
I love Netflix and watch on my phone and laptop. For a while though when I try to watch on my phone sometimes at random times but mainly when I starting a new episode or show the screen turns into green and people static. The audio works fine but the screen is all messed up. To make it go back to normal I have to restart my phone at least once everytime. Please fix this! It really makes me mad that I can't enjoy watching a show without having to do all this technical work first!
Refuses to open it just says choose an account and when I do choose my account it closes the app...frustrating
Laggy application with useless customer support. Also they give money to con artists like Gwyneth Paltrow.
"This app used to work fine with nice content but now it is not even opening in my phone. Also I don't like it's feature to save your bank card details. Developers, kindly see to the problem."
I DON'T WANT PERMANENT SUBTITLES ON EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!
Good app. But with the new update it keeps exiting when ever an episode is over. It doesn't go to next episode. So have to click on the series to continue. So frustrating! ðŸ˜ 
Paid service only
"Good show,but i have 3 issues. 1. When i watch a video it stop by itself. 2. When the video pauses by itself in wont play 3. When im waiting to find (search) something, it says ""Oh darn we don't have that: please search some characters, genre, etc."" But i searched some characters, genre and etc. It says that word again. So i gave you 2 stars, and thats all."
"After a recent update the app on my phone (OnePlus 5T) now has bugs and doesn't work as intended. When I open the app sometimes I get an (-1023) error code, it takes me closing the app and opening it again for me to access the shows. (My internet connection is fine YouTube works) I have also lost the spotlight section on the app and the picture-in-picture is not working properly. (The show plays but I can't pause or open the app again through the small window. (I am still on Android 9)"
"It's a great app the only thing that's not nice, I have been watching flash for a long time and the next day it's gone so fix it"
"Since updating the app back in June, have been facing a video lag, audio sync and jarred playback on forwarding 10secs. There were 2 updates after this and still the issue is not fixed. It is really annoying and a very bad user experience. Please fix it."
Resume watching stopped.
This is like watching free plays at the community centre.
The app is crashing on my OnePlus 7T
"I can't open my Netflix,,,,, when I just click on app it's disappeared"
"After updating Netflix app, it is asking to select email ID and on selecting app is just getting shut down automatically. Tried re-installing also but same issue persists."
On the first day I downloaded Netflix it worked perfectly but the next day it stopped working and it wasnt even loading I left my phone on fire hours just to let it load to see if its gonna work but it didn't.
"there are series like van helsing and supernatural, suddenly disappears and I will get an error message that it is not available in my area. seriously? UPDATE I cannot install Netflix in my vivo s1 pro. Why?"
"Always saying I can't connect or I'm offline when I have good connection, even the website is not loading. Need to always re-install the app so I can fixed this issue."
Content is good. The app is terrible. It spams me with content I have no interest in. You can't browse a text list of TV shows or movies - you are limited to about twelve items in various categories that Netflix decides to show you. You can search if you know what you want but you can't browse what's available. Everything is images so it's hard to scan content. It's just really difficult and stressful to use. I really hate this app.
Do not like leaving my card information on file also each month charge my card without notifications....take card off..
"I get the ""this title is not available"" error way too often."
Not saving play progress
it doent have all the movies i wantto watch on it and now it wont let me on the app its says i have to restart it and i did now it says the device is failed and now i cant get on it and that sucks because i mainly watch it on here and now i cant they need to fix it so i can watch it i hope this helps you
I cant get PIP with new update had it before idk what happened...plse fix it!!!!
Needs more tv shows
Could be better on new movies.
Indian netflix sucks..no new titles... Angel has fallen came out in 2019 and its still not available on Netflix.... Attack on Titans anmie series is missing also. And black clover released 120 above episodes and on Netflix only 50 are available... Why r u late
This app randomly has stopped working sadly since I truly was enjoying it. Having the same issues as the other reviews. Hope this will be rectified.
It's nice
I gave it 3 stars because the app drops very often.
Sering ngelag padahal udah banyak aplikasi dihapus dan juga sudah bersihin ram tetep aja
Not bad app
says sorry could not reach the netflix service(-1023)
I love it
Getting 5.8 error while watching on phone
"It's got good shows, but this is the third time I have had to uninstall/reinstall because the app just stopped working."
it keeps exiting whenever I skip a scene
ðŸ‘
"Fix the bugs! It's used to be the best app but now, what happened men??? Movie keeps on loading every 4-5 mins.."
"I want to install and use this app..its asks my card details , which is only mode of payment... Kindly udpate ur payments details-"
Why are new seasons of Seven Deadly Sins not yet available? I thought it's out by Aug.6?
I cannot watch anything through this app
I cant log in. I install the app but still encountered the same error saying they couldn't reach the Netflix service. Just update the app yesterday and encounter again the same error
New update breaks picture in picture mode. When I activate multitasking it freezes the show.This is very annoying. If this is fixed quickly I would rate the app 5/5.
"Using a Samsung Galaxy 10, app closes out every time I attempt to open it. Conveniently worked long enough for me to re-enter my payment info."
All want is to watch haikyuu but there a bug
à¤”à¤”à¤”à¤¶à¥€à¤ˆ
I used to love this app. But now it's gotten too many notifications that seem too spammy about watch this watch this watch this. It feels like I get three or four a day. I like the notifications in the past because it was a good way to find a new content. But when they're so darn many it gets really annoying and when they're everyday it's really annoying.
"Now the new update is bad, not able to see the movie Ratings now. We want movie Ratings before watching it. This is bad"
"My biggest issue is with the app's compatability with VPNs. Even using ExpressVPN, it barely works. Blurry image, stuterring and crashing is frequent"
I can't add anything to My List. It will select the button and church it then instantly go back n to the plus sign to add the show/movie 8/7/2020: same thing happening
Gave 5 starts at the beginning. The app isn't functioning properly! I paid for it now regretting! Worst experience.
"Ran the update...now ""My List"" is no longer part of the scroll down. So now I have to search every show I had on my list from now on? What numbskull did this? I was giving this app a 3 because of this issue ...but decided to downgrade it to a two for the shear stupidty of it."
"I have fully downloaded episodes, but it always crashes and says there's a network error 2.119 or whatever it was. I'm conserving data usage, kindly fix this issue."
He doesn't even show the full show ðŸ˜¡
I like it
Not that good
Enjoy watching
Hate the new update ðŸ˜’ hate it some much got me using Hulu more
My power went out a few days ago so I was watching shows I downloaded but yesterday it stopped letting me watch them.
I dont really like it bevause you cant even put a full series in
"Last update broke multiwindow, app from play store doesn't work on rooted phone, and it has Draconian anti screenshot issues. I get antipiracy is an issue but they couldn't prevent screenshotting for memes on PC and that's a good thing. You should by rights have access to frames displayed on a screen you own. App will also start playing audio when any other app stops playing it regardless of whether it's a top view at all or not. That's supremely irritating and affects performance. Its a mess."
No log in alllowed
Please add Kannada language movies too. ..
I had given 5 stars but in recent update I'm not able to resume my viewing.
Not working on chromebook keeps coming up cant contact netflix try again later (-14) and then just won't load even after un install re instal stuck on loading screen please sort out still the same after current update needs sorting
netflix takes sooooooo soooooo long to lode on any of my devices. it gets very frustrating when all i want to do is download some movies for my upcoming camping trip and netflix never has GOOD new STUFF. NOT IMPRESESD
"I used to really enjoy this app, I travel a lot with work and having it on my phone was great. However, for some unknown reason it no longer offers me the full selection of films or series, when I am home and on my main console, I get everything but away with work and on my phone, half my watchlist isn't there and according to the search bar, those programmes don't exist on netflix."
Netflix is a cool way to pass time... I think the price raising needs to stop tho... And the request movie is usless I've been requesting for over a year and not one movie has been added... Then the onces you get into they remove so when I'm bored I used them but I've found CHEAPER way to watch movies with a much bigger choice of what I can and cannot watch... Get it together Netflix
I opened Netflix App & Recharged it with â‚¹199 Plan. & then After My Netflix keeps on closing as soon as I open it! Plz resolve this problem ASAP!
Its an ok app. I dont understand why everyone likes it so much. There is barely any variety of shows and it has been removing shows and adding netflix originals which i personally dont like
"Why I can't have the access what has been released recently , there is seven deadly sins season 4 which has been released on Netflix on 6th aug but still I am unable to see that"
4 ðŸ“€7
"Picture-In-Picture was working beautifully until the update yesterday. Now, when I leave the app, the picture-in-picture box is still on screen, but it pauses. Tapping the play button doesn't work."
i like it but when therse a new update movie thers nothing
You have pay for it
It's not working. I'm unable to open the app
Why your app doesn't support rupay card
Not working properly
Everytime I'm opening this app it shows can't reach Netflix servers error 1001. Fix this please.
"You guys suck, the service is good but the app is trash. I just lost almost 20gb of data for no freaking reason. All of my downloads just disappeared without warning."
You need to step up your game! We need naruto shippuden on there! And Boruto to!! Like come on!!! I don't want to watch ads on hulu just to watch Naruto shippuden!
I stop my drama halfway to do something urgent. And continue watched it the next day. But it not continue where i stop yesterday. It play from the start twice. Please fix this problem. It make me turn off.
Latest movies list is not available and video quality is not good and very important thing is account security is not good. Account privacy and security should be improved a lot
Keeps shutting down on its own. Doesn't open at times.
"I really like the app, love the service but the only detail I find to improve is the waiting time before a movie or a new season is available, sometimes it takes 1 or 2 years before a movie is uploaded and some tittles are not available, I'm sorry it takes so long and some other apps have the missing tittles and take far less time, I hope you guys can improve that to rate you better."
The application doesn't have indigeneous indian content.
I love this app but the seasons are producing very slow ðŸŒðŸŒðŸŒ
Add more payment method
Some of these movies/ programs are awfully made. Occasionally it won't start up and claims there is an error. Needs a more interesting selection.
Gadi wala poem
"Hey, i hope there can pay with google play balance, because i don't have visa debitcard just local in Indonesia. So i just want the payment can pay with google play balance"
Every time i get to last minutes of the movies netflix stops and says it has errors. So i dont get to finish any of the movies
"Great app yes, but since last update it has been extremely slow. Gets worse after every update subtitles are not aligned with the film. Content is getting worse and worse since Netflix insist on putting only their own content where you might have one good one out of a 100"

"When it works it's an average streaming service, WHEN it works, it will constantly ""sorry we can't reach these titles at this time, try again later"" and don't expect any of their originals to ever get new episodes, they will just keep crapping out as many as they can, and not actually continue the ones they already have. Honestly Hulu has better content anyway, Netflix just wants all originals so they don't have to pay royalties for good movies and shows from better networks."
Why doesnt the movie/show I add to my list go to the top of my list? Just shows up in the list wherever. Not worth it anymore.
"the app suddenly stopped working, but when it did work it was good."
Br

"The app always plays grainy, and always freezes."
"Shows keep randomly pausing whilst I'm watching. It's not my connection and it seems to happen at random times, but will be a constant issue for a good 10 minutes at a time. STILL HAPPENING PLEASE FIX."
My movies keep sticking every second you need to fix your network
Cannot use dual screen anymore after update since netflix pauses contemt when clicking on second screen. Before I would watch on netflix while using other apps on the second screen
"Does not connect to my chrome cast, it keep showing error afyer the update"
Freeze
Poor
Here lately keeps claiming error whenever I click on the app. Other times it will say error while in the middle of watching a show.
Everytime i go to open the app and log in it crashes I've tried deleting and redownloading but nothings working.
Can u tell me when is the seven deadly sins season 5 is gonna come bec I have watched its season 4 already
My app doesn't get open shows some error.
"This app keeps switching from when i set it to use ONLY WI-FI, and then it sets to automatic which uses up my data"
' I cannot open it after i download this app .. so sad . ðŸ˜”â˜¹ï¸
Just ease off the leftist narrative propagation and will be awesome
Netflix should start wallet payments also
When I am watching a show on my device and go to answer a text or slme the Picture by Picture screen in the bottom corner of your screen stops pauses the show.
"can't open the app, it's showing cookies is missing, once i uninstall and install the app it's opening normally for that time itself, if i close the app then i have to uninstall and re install it again to watch, may i know the issue..."
Super
Price is to high
"After the update, app won't open, kept showing error. Had to uninstall and reinstall again which is a complete bummer"
I found that it limited to many shows so we cannot access to all of them
those movies are carzy in porn
"The update isn't great. I often have a black screen with sound, something that I didn't have before, so you have to keep restar your phone.. I had to reverse to an old version to be able to see,much better now. Don't update"
I have a problem where the downloads kept failing even my network is stable
I use mobile only but atlest allow download on 2 device even if there is no download it says it has just because i have formatted my device fix this.
"Apps would not open.stack on netflix logo from the start.what should i do?already updated the app..do troubleshooting found on your page. resetting of modem.turning off and on ,and install unstall the program on my device"
OK
Not batter or not ðŸ‘Ž
Great but too much expensive
"Leaving this review because I can't find a way to contact Netflix about technical issues with their app, which is just one problem - you can't report bugs and you can't contact them about missing ""skip intro"" buttons. My issue with the app is that I'm finding a lot of series/movies won't allow me to add to my favourites or add a reminder. You'll tap to add it and it'll register a tick for a second before reverting back to the bell or ""plus"" icon. It works with some series but not with others."
Need to revamp this app. Fast forward & trailer for most of the contents options not available unlike other streaming apps when played via chromecast.
"When your watching something the play/pause icon goes away and you have to close and restart the app to get it to pop back up. Fix the app you bunch of marxist morons, 7/10/20 still not fixed, 9/6/20 still not fixed,"
"I am still having the same problem after another update. It just keeps on loading and I cannot see what is what. Please fix this I'd love to watch again. And as I read through the other reviews, Everyone Else Is Having The Same Problem! When you fix it I'll change my review.8"
"Terrible, shows. but good shots xx-Ava"

"Netflix is great with all the movies and series it offers to the watcher. However, I've been having the problem about the VPN or proxy, netflix says when I don't even have a clue about what it is talking about. Meanwhile, my sister, and 2 cousins whom I share my account with has no problem playing videos on the app. Please, fix this. I'm clearly disappointed about it."
It muchly watch about a minute of of program cuts me off comes back and says having trouble running this video every time I watch it
Constantly displaying Error 5.10 when playing video.
Why we can't recharge netflix with rupay....it only allow visa nd master card..plz make it right so that more indian users can enjoy netflix.
can't buy using prepaid payment. hmm please
Some times there is a problem while opening the app it's just show Netflix and nothing else is happening.
Too many updates.
I never had Netflix before because it's cost money. it says have a free trail but then asks for your credit card number.
As soon as I plug my HDMI cable into the laptop to the TV the downloads loose video but keep sound. Would like you to fix this issue

"I like this app, but sometimes the audio and video of the shows gets out of sync, which is annoying."
"My downloads keep disappearing and then my download ""limit"" is reached when I need to re-download. 7 different shows, 5 different rounds of deletions, zero warning given. All downloads are there, and then every download is gone. It's not happening on any other account I share with, and is not just my own device, based on some other reviews here. Started about 1 month ago. It has nothing to do with updates or anything either."
It logged me out for no reasons and now all of my shows are are gonna be gone I would have have gave this a 5 but because of that when it gets better I will give it a 5 this has happened 2 times so please fix This!!!!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Stupid app always crashes....always say device faliure tried everything no use and even if it works some videos say cant play right now.....
Takes a little too long to search through the trash you build up in there. Lol please throw away the garbage clutter
The app is good but my problem is that if I download a movie before I watch it it will delete
Good
Doesn't allow me to download movies
Awsome
Nice content but algorithm is boring. Doesn't understand my taste yet even tho i use it for a year
They do not keep me posted on shows that I have watch seen and like NCIS it's been so long I have been able to find out when are you going to put the new season in Blue Bloods what is going on I know that you see what other people want and what is in demand I think that you should try to accommodate your customers but anyways I know that you have a lot of other people to besides myself I wish you had more where I can choose this way I would not have to spend so much money somewhere else just to
Want the older UI of this app. In older UI we could watch previous directly without opening it...plz Netflix fix it and give us older UI...
Netflix was working amazingly until recently. Im unable to watch anything full screen. It's just black. Once it plays in a PIP mode it works fine but who can watch Netflix like that? A small screen in the corner of my phone?
I can't open Netflix
there is a new update which is called screen limit this update us basically were only 4 people can use the app at once which sucks because I share my account with a lot of people and now I cant even watch.
"Love Netflix but the new change keeps the title on screen when paused so you can't pause to read text that appears on screen. Hate that new feature, please change!"
Good
It started out well when one day it says to many downloads when i only had one download
Ew as re err 3rm=sty k set 77777uu77
Well the app is amazing its just I can't find my favorite anime
"Just recharged again for a month and started, continues crashing repeatedly. Why ? Bad experience"
Need more audio for anime on Netflix
"Hi Team, I have done recharge today.. amount deducted from my account . But when i open app its closing automatically.I checked my emails it's been long back membership had been cancelled. When I clicked on start membership again its asking for payment ..So, how should I proceed with this now?"
Not worth it
"Keep having issues with netflix freezing recently. I've updated deleted and reinstalled but nope still being a pain. I dont really rate much of the shows thats currently being aired either, late on seasons by years or missing seasons completely. Selection is outdated at best and part from the odd netflix original most are terrible choices. Suggestions are a waste of time as 90% of it is nothing like what you've watched just what is new on netflix. If they don't improve I can see them fading"
Can't open since update on Android 10
I renewed my subscription 2 days a go but couldn't log in on my phone . What's the matter please?
Why are u not showing the vampire diaries on Netflix plzzz show it plzzz bcoz it's my fav series on and that's why i m paying to Netflix now its not showing and even Charles angels are not in the Netflix why? Can u explain???
Every movie or tv show I watch always flickers when it gets to the end of the movie or television show. I hope you can fix it
Hope you can upload more Indian movies. The movies uploaded are already available on Amazon prime. I sometimes Feel it is waste of money.
Please switch back to pin access for age related content. It was easier to restrict access to individual movies and tv shows without having to switch between profiles. Netflix has some content that I wouldn't allow my kids to watch however in order to restrict a movie or tv shows I must now restrict the Netflix profile by age. This does not help because some content I would allow my kids to watch. Its much easier to use pin for each movie and show.

"The newly updated app doesn't seem to fit with the Dark Mode of the cellphone. When one clicks any movies/shows, then the details appear to be fuzzy in white which doesn't go well with the Dark Mode. It was not there in previous versions. Please resolve this issue."

"Hey Netflix. I bought another sim pack for this, spent money.. And it says invalid :( I made my Mom go outside for this and it's quarantine..

I love Netflix but if it has a book app to read the books with us paying with mobile money it will be helpful for us without credit card.
"Netflix is a great platform but the app is very buggy, really disappointed with the android mobile Netflix app i hope they fix the app in the next update ..."
Provide imdb rating
Netflix i am huge fan.. But u remember what happend to tik-tok and to it's ratings in a simgle day.. So please stop promoting nepotism content for money.. It has caused a life of an actor he died fighting all this alone. #Stop nepotism. #Be human
"The app has great video quality, I must commend that, buh everytime I download a video, the next day I want to watch it, I can't find the video in my downloads. It has happened several times since I started using that app. I thought videos on the app was supposed to last seven days??"
Picture in Picture mode is not working although my phone runs on Android 8.1
Netflix is not playing in fullscreen on oneplus 8 and it is very annoying watching movies and shows with the camera cutout black band. Please make the movies and shows playback to view in fullscreen in next update.
"I like neflix and all but, you have to include all the movies, im talking about The Magnifiecient Seven and others because i dont see them in Neflix, in Google Chrome there were Neflix links but pressing it will redirect you to Neflix but its just infinite loading.

If you ARE younger good for you and this app may have decent stuff for you. The great music was 1959-1979 while truly good non-profane and non-sex-overkill-TV WAS ARGUABLY limited to most of the periods noted above. While NOT AT ALL A PRUDE, ARE THINGS NOT BAD ENOUGH to where we must add that speach/LOVEâ€¢LESS sex?!"
I love the shows but I didn't like that you took out naruto out of the kid users and can you put godzilla in the kid users
Not sure if anybody else is having this issue but I keep getting kicked out to the title page or having Netflix crash all together. I'm also having subtitles randomly start and stop. Gets aggravating having to uninstall and reinstall to get it to go back to normal. Anybody else having the issue of playing several episodes of a series and then getting kicked back to one random series in a different season? And it was just updated last month?? Try again Netflix!
Series are great but the app performance is awful everytime I finishes 1 episode it would just go on non stop loading and I have to power cycle my device for it to work. And the cycle goes on. Don't blame the internet connection I have a very good one.
Can you add Google pay features on payment mode??? Bcoz my card is not a support for a payment so you add bhim upi on payment detail
I just upgraded my netflix so I could watch my phone. App not worth it as it keeps on Spooling endlessly like it was looking for a connection. Not so as my email and you tube were workong very well.
Take away the brightness slide its so annoying i have to adjust the brightness everytime i go on here i dont understand who thought that would be a good idea we can all control our brightness from our phones why do we need to control it on netflix.
"I can't see the button for seasons of some shows, as well as the playback speed button."
It worked fine before but now when it automatically rotates the brightness goes way down and I can't see anything??? It wont even let me access my brightness level even though it's as bright as it can go when I initially open the app. I have no idea whats going on or how to fix this. Tried restarting my phone and updating the app and it nothing changes
"Lack of feature This app doesn't have faster playing option such as other media players do. Normal 1.25 1.5 1.75 or 2 times fast playing option This help to view at whatever speed one want, especially this feature is best for documentary to watch at 1.5 times speed. There a lot slow speed narrators in the documentary and thats waste of time."
Not the movies that I want.
199/- per month is reasonable and appreciable. Yet Indian have to take a MasterCard or visa card for the payment as most of the Indians possess Rupay debit card. That's bit disappointing. Netflix please reply.
Recently I havent been able to watch Dolby Vision videos.It just stops after sometime and says error 5.10. Other videos play just fine.I have already tried clearing app data.My device is LG G6.Hope you guys fix this soon!
Dear Netflix Please keep an option to pay you from Paytm and phonepay & Google pay.Because everyone can't add their debit and credit cards That's why I am saying you to add the Paytm and phonepay options If you add the Paytm and phonepay & Google pay options un your Netflix then people will able to pay you Directly from their apps This will really helpful for peopleThey will be so happy if this Paytm app option be there Please try to understand our problems.Please keep Hollywood movies in Telugu
I can never connect on my mobile in spite of me having the most expensive package.
nice
"Pls bring back the title, sometimes I can't read the title on the banner, it's annoying because you need to look closely to read the title. thank you."
its okay i mean its not working for me
The Netflix app not working properly
"Lots of annoying notifications, can't disable the annoying PiP Miniplayer. Always thought better of them. Playback works, though, and the download functionality as well as the amount of required data are good"
"So the service is down for a long time, ok I get it. But why can't I watch my downloaded movies? There are in my phone, I have downloaded them , it shld be easy to be played while the service is down. You would expect that from your app !"
app stalls when opening
Expensive app
I was watching the Vampire Diaries on it and suddenly the next day the show was removed from our Country.It was really disappointing.Seriously Annoyed.
"To be honest, It's great I would love to give it three or more stars, at the same time not really because once I download it it forces me to start a 30 day trail. I don't mind it but the problem with it is once I log in it logs me out instantly and I try to re-login but the same thing happens time and time again! And things were only getting worse."
What the F*** is happening after recharge is done app not getting opened several times I tried still the same result not expected from such huge brand...
Error all the time. Needing to disable the app before reopening. What a hassle
Frustrating I'm locked out of the app for month now keep saying I can't reach your servicer what does this even mean
"Very disappointed of how the app is working. A lot of bugs, a lot of wholes in UX, no simple UI translations. Is it a top streaming service? Really? Looks like this service was launched a couple of months ago. Once I'll find another service, I'll close my account here."
I don't know why I am having error issues with Netflix even if I am watching any originals the whole screen is getting green coloured please look into this issues I have uninstalled the app and again installing it I don't know whether video will work after this or not..
My app isn't opening. Everytime i try to open it says unable to reach server - (1023).
Always could not reach netflix
"Content is not better anymore, quality decreases"
I'm having problems with many series. I can't see them because they just don't stream correctly.
App doesnt open properly...need to uninstall and then reintall....
"Always prompting ""Sorry, we could not connect to Netlix service. Please try again later. (-1023)."" Fix this!"
When I use earphone on this app it's not working some time works
Good
Just today morning i was watching Netflix and it had the option to speed up or slow down the video. But now it disappeared. It has lock screen option where the speed option used to be. What happened suddenly?
It's full of garbage I get your letting more shows run but I watch a lot of anime and all I get is cocomelon and cartoons on my list. I can't believe it all sucks so bad the new shows are better but sort out recommendations please.
"I could not open Netflix,there is some problem in opening Netflix on a samsung device,pls look towards it"
Super
Please make more dubbed anime on Netflix I beg of you come on or else I'm going to come back on here and give it a one star and a terrible review
Before this i download movie easily.. now there was some error showed DLST.N141.. and the worst part is i don't know what is the problem.. try to search online there was no solution about it..
Cool but i have a question.... WHY THE HECK IS HANNAH MONTANA NOT ON HERE!! So not cool....i am very hurt by that and i..im sorry ðŸ˜ži just really can NOT believe it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Ok
Its a good app but for awhile noslw um... everytime i watch something on here it um likes to freeze up with the circle in the middle like its trying to load but dont know why its doing that it didnt do that beforeðŸ¤”â¤ï¸
I had to delete the app then re install it. Now it won't open at all.
"It's awful to use this knowing that there's been a lot of new seasons already ""aired"" that we can't see in Spain."
Pretty ok. Split screen doesnt work.
"Video streaming quality takes a lot of time to get to the maximum quality of the video even with good internet speeds,being a streaming service this is the primary, it has to be improved a lot..."
When I forward the video for 10 secs the video freezes. this happens on multiple mobile devices. Please fix this.

Hi it's good but sometimes it just freezes and I can still hear adio I would give it a 5 star if it didn't do that
Every time I login it shows an error. I have to uninstall it then reinstall it to login into my account. Very bad experience.!! This should be rectified ASAP!!
Somw of the anime i watch are gone
Good
"Everything was fine until code error appeared. I had to uninstall then installl and when I login back, all drama/movie I have downloaded gone.. I had to redownload.... Internet consumed."
"The brightness should be based on my phone's current settings, not the last time I used the app. Would prefer they bring back the 'are you still watching?' after several episodes play too as i fall asleep with it on quite often. Also not a fan of the lack of update information, which are instead useless snark."
I can download very fast in this app but I think it's better to put more Movies and Tv Shows because I can't find my favorites that I want to watch again.
Used to be a 5 star but one of the things I liked most about netflix on my phone was being able to leave it in the corner of the screen while I do something which was removed in the most recent update. Please bring it back
I'm new user but its already have bugs in downloading olease fix this
I like Netflix so much....but we must have more new movies please
"The app is great of course. But whatever the latest update did, it's not working. I can't fast forward without the video freezing while the audio goes on. Have to move backwards until I find a section that is moving."
It takes months for them to release new movies or new seasons.
taking more time to load
It's a really good app but about 3 or 4 days ago it started gliching and it doesn't play any of my shows it doesn't even open. I deleted it and re-installed but still the same problem. It's really annoying that I always have to delete and re download the app after my wifi goes down because it doesn't play unless I delete and re install
Fast forward is not working on android !

I downloaded some movies on Netflix through my Android device and now I want to screen mirror it my TV because my Android device's screen is too small. But it doesn't work. Please help
PUT THAT 70S SHOW BACK ON >:(
No problems
"Overall i love Netflix, but on my galaxy note 10+ (from VzW), this app is bloatware. Meaning it comes preinstalled on the device, and the only option that you have is to disable the app, uninstalling it completely is not available (Rooting is not an option since it is illegal in the US, and voids warranty). I dont really think this is all netflix fault, nor do i blame samsung, at least for this app, partly since it was downloaded via the google play store and not the galaxy store."
Its good i always watch netflix.ðŸ˜
Nice
Too much sub-standard content. U actually donno that actual good ones that release.
Same movies need some new stuff
Does not have enough movie options.
Love it. But I am starting to have a glitch where the image freezes and sound continue.
Doesn't have that much anime
Didn't watch it. Plus cant afford it.
Need more new content and up to date shows will all seasons not just part
It freezes constantly and i cannot finish a season
"was really fun for a long time. but this app has really grown bad with age. loosing a ton of content to new streaming services. so now Netflix is left with very little other then the awful sequels of movies, b movies, and original content which the original content is hit and miss has some good originals like stranger things, voltron, and a few more."
Needs more PG movies

"Netflix was working fine yesterday and earlier today on my chromebook. it now doesnt load and just has the netflix logo in the middle. if i wait long enough i get a pop up that says ""netflix isnt loading"" or some errror code. its happened before and it works the next day, but im just posting this review so hopefully the netflix team can get this working again."
i love it sometimes its slow but it is really good my fav tv show is the vampire diaries and outer banks the reason i love these shows is bc there is always some mystery. another thing about it is im trying to cromecast and its not really helpfull in this sinario. also it could use another update. and im really upset that you took the fosters off of netflix. if your reading this netflix pls pls bring it back and pls put another season on jullie and outer banks. other than that its an amazing ap
There are a whole lot of movies that are recommended but I don't like. How can I get more of a variety?
"basically never allows me to add anything to my watchlist, havent been able to figure out why i constantly get an error message"
"Would have given it a 5, but I keep seeing the same movies over and over. Please add new ones!"
After the update my PIP seems not to be working. Everything is fine other than it. Look into it. My device : MI A3
Lagging

Ok

It doesn't work great when I'm in Europe.
It crashes for me lately
Netflix is great but the fact that content is available and then suddenly it's no longer available highly bugs me. I know it's all about licenses but often there's an abrupt stop and you can't finish a series because it's no longer there
I keep having to re-downlod it
Good
Keeps forgetting where I am in a TV show or movie. Very annoying.
Only three coz it keeps signing me out every time I turn it on and you have to pay.
I can't watch on my phone when I do watch movies it throws me off
Okay
How come I can't watch season 9 it's not even on here of My Little Pony
"Why do we have to pay,why it can't be free."
"I love Netflix but since the last two updates it only makes the app messy. It plays okay at the first few minutes then the video will stop but the audio processed, I tried to exit the video then enter agin but it still the same, it plays the audio but the video is still not moving, then I tried to uninstall the app but nothing change, well i think it only made the app worst..."
recent update making it crash a lot
Enjoy watching but cumbersome searching for what to watch. Worse than channel surfing.
The new update cause freezing on the screen if we skip the video
Good got some good show's
Nice
Netflix.. Why prepaid can't buy a rm17 plan.. Why.. ðŸ¥º
Recently the video gets stuck when forwarding or going back. It is very annoying. The audio continues however the video gets completely stuck everytime.
After installing the app and using then i can come back for another star
Ok
"If do not update, screen goes black."
My samsung a20s takes time for me to sign in in netflix.. sometimes it only shows loading gif and then nothing happens..
"There are not all content, in each program some seasons are missing so please take concern of this serious matter on indian server , if you made this done there will be chance for more netflix customers."
hi am facing Black screen with only audio from yesterday help me figure out how to fix!
There is no download option for some of the TV shows. Why?
The video took too long i had restart my phone before it plays
Yah its quiet good...â¤

"Estou tendo problemas na reproduÃ§Ã£o da sÃ©rie Sherlock Holmes, o vÃ­deo comeÃ§a a travar, porÃ©m o Ã¡udio continua reproduzindo. Espero poder mudar minha avaliaÃ§Ã£o no futuro."
I really love it but recently it keeps crashing & chucking me out on phone & TV. Can be so irrating to the point where i give up trying too watch something to the end! Even thought about uninstalling & stopping my payment as it ruins the experience & makes it stressful so sometimes doesn't seem worth the money when i can just watch sky movies without issues! 2 yr old gets upset too when his favourite film chucks him out constantly! Its been the last month its got bad! Maybe after the update?!
"it needs more old movies and new movies, I think should lower $"
Everything is good except the subscription price
Tara gah lem styleðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
More kdrama please
"The app is good but , I'm surprised that Netflix has taken victorious and Sam and cat from Netflix , and that's why I rated it 3/5 because Netflix removed my 2 favorite TV shows"
Film selections are outdated and limited.
Experience iss good but some important shows are not available in netflix.
Note you may need to restart your phone as all bar three thumbnails disappeared on mine. Yawn.
it doesn't have enough movies for me to watch
"Otherwise a fantastic app but deducted 2 stars for the following reason... 1. Not the entire Netflix library is present which is a bummer, because we are paying the same amount as people in other country. 2. No video quality switcher in the online player itself. More user control over the video quality would be awesome..."
This app is very good but you have series which have half of the seasons out of all of them so please add all other seasons of serials especially ben 10 classic Please
Very good ap

"Tolong tambah opsi pembayaran, saya tidak punya kartu kredit."
Scammed me of 10$
I've never had a problem with it until now. I've uninstalled it several times and it stillcrashed every time I try to open the app.
Kept updating the app but oftentimes it would crash and would not let me play/pause the video.
You should add ben 10 to netflix Canada.
can you please release naruto: shippuden ?
I've had it for two weeks and it hasn't connected for the last two days
"Good app but plans are little experience,my mean 499 per month sorry but it is better that I choose any other platform for entertainment like hostar VIP"
ðŸ‘
"Sometimes when I search for a movie or tv series, google said that it can be found at netflix but when Im already at netflix its not... ex. Last Airbender."
It has good shows but it doesn't have all the seasons and I wish they had the whole TV show instead of just part of it.
Happy
Netflix is really good but I hate how they remove something and add it and then remove it.
Not enough recent release films for proce
"Cuz I watch netflixs on tv, I wanted to watch avatar but they removed it so pls for you to have 4 or 5 star bring avatar series back to this app Joke!!!but I was really sad that they remove some shows that you want to watch pls bring back avatar and add the Hero academia more complete episodes pls so I can watch my avatar again with my anime"
Good
Just kinda good
Pongan mid90s ðŸ˜”
I love it but sadly I can't watch my favorite movie Victorious and Sam and Cat I wish u would extend the season
Would like to have more options for other types of movies
Good
You can't turn off the subtitles
"If you want me to update every three days, at least add something worth watching. It is very annoying to look every day and see the same movies over and over."
Great but I wish there was legend of korra on the UK netflix
I'm first time download this application..hope good and nice..
"What went wrong, after the update I cannot play any shows or Movies, not even the ones that r downloaded"
Is fine but it just the data
Good
"Whenever I close a show/movie and come back to it later, it's not continuing where I left off which is frustrating because I have to forward through episodes just to find the part from where I last watched. I love this app so much but please fix this issue."
"I've had netflix for about 3 years & I've enjoyed all the good shows they've played. Though, recently they are doing away with some good shows & adding shows I don't really care much for. I have not unscribed yet but I watch it less and less. So, for this next mo. I will see how it does for me. If it continues with these good shows I hear are being taking off then I may keep netflix. If not I will be letting it go. Sorry Netflix..."
"I actually like this app, but sometimes a TV show got cancelled or something and I can't watch them again even though i really love that show :(. Over all good app except for the cancellation of a TV show"
take some telugu super star films
Never disappoint but wish anime like my hero academia and death note was dubbed and wanna watch the flash :(
Need server in indonesia.
Good
It doesn't leave where I left off when I finish an episode.
I can get audio but no video
Its great but can you ad the legend of korra in netflix tho? Book 1 to Book 4? Plss if you do that i would be so happy!
I like the movies
Love this app... however I would like to see language control on every movie... mute swear words and such.
Please make an option to turn off autoplay in the app and make it more intuitive for kids profiles. I can understand why youd prefer this feature left on but kind of dodgy to bury it and make it only accessible from pc. I shouldn't have to Google how to turn off an annoying feature.
Thumbs upðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
"Its like the lottery, finding a good movie. Unbelievable amount of junk movies."
Very Good!
Add more animated like dc and marvel tv shows plssssss
Same old same old
I love netflix
Netflix you better get black panther ðŸ˜­ðŸ™
Play forward/backward is broken in the latest update. Forward/backward the video cause syncing issue between video and audio. I had to close the player again and restart the video to fix the issue. I am using OnePlus 5t with android 10
Wish they have more current tv shows to watch Updated 9/29/2020 Still nothing good here but too cheap to cancel subscription
Its good
Good
It's too good
App is good but for every payment I'm facing difficulty
"I dont like political messages, like "" black lives matter"". I watch Netflix to get away from the chaotic world we live in. No more Cuties / kiddie porn or i will cancel"
Pls keep Hindi section in your audio section We are paying a lot ..but can't enjoy Netflix because of language choice option ...I m from India and want hindi audio
Quality
Please do something about the slow sound in mobile.
Why this has a retry payment?!ðŸ˜­I can't watch Netflix now!
"Top 10 in the U.S. section constantly disappears, annoying. I don't like when I delete something off my watch history and then it still shows that I've watched it and my progress of how far I watched, even after the 24 hour mark. I want that completely erased. Want the option to pause subscription and not just cancel it. I don't want my account erased if I decide to stop watching for a moment."

"Please add naruto shippuden ,Why keep shows which aren't complete on Netflix, for example you don't have naruto s10 which is the main part of the naruto series that is Available on natak"
Good
It's a good app but lately it has been crashing.. I download an episode to watch n when I'm actually watching it just crashes out n send me to my home page.. When it does this I can't open it for a few days since it gets stuck at the start screen where it just shows Netflix
We've encounter an error (every day)phew.
Still waiting for shows to appear while it's on hulu already. Out of date with movies
Need more updated movies. They dont even have the new jumanji
I like it but hate it won't show other shows when the one you've watched is over automatically.
Good
Greatest
Don't know this app
Awsome!
I've used you for years without problems. When you added the brightness option that is when i started to have issues. I've now had to reinstall the app to fix a brightness issue twice now and it is getting old. still not going back to bright after my second reload.
this app is grate but it updats real slow thats why i gave it a three3 i hope you enjoy Netflix's btw i dont know how to right a reviews soo ya
It shows good movies
Getting always stucked..last version was good one..no movie name appears...should check the last version....need to change the developer...
Its great for a few months but then when you've watched all the movies and shows that interest you theres rarely much new added. Also for those with a slower internet connection audio sync can be a problem. I think apps like viewster and showbox are the future plus they're free!
Cool
Doesn't have the shows I want to see
Have a hard time getting in and buffering takes too long! Good Movies once in! Like it a Little bit!
"The new update has problem with the skip forward buttons . There is a lag between the audio and the video after clicking forward buttons two to three times. , Have to close the video and then start to get the sync back to normal"
needs more shows
Chilled app Hurry up and Download.
Your PC version doesn't pause a download or show download progress. And doesn't work audio when connected with HDMI cable to my TV.
i dont know I never tryed it oh I am going on it now see ya later I hope it is good
"It was great, but recently, even when the internet connection is good, I get nothing but a black screen with audio on everything I watch."
Payment issue every time

"Hi!! I can't somehow open this app anymore.They stated saying ""choose one account to smartlock (or whatever I cant remember) so I pressed the account that I smartlocked and turns out,, it cant be opened anymore. Hope you read my review!! Tyy"
Its okay
Why you guys deleted Vampire Diaries ðŸ˜¢
Good
Couldn't download alot of shows at once
Not able to download videos in 1080p even though Widevine L1 supported
Need more movies
The problem is i cant renew my payment...with debit card...and there is no other options....so quit...ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
I used to keep getting 501. -116 and -1001 errors even if it has already been updated. The problem got solved after I cleared the data and cache of the app.
I watch anime here but there's always no ep I watched fairy tail and I only has 3s here but it has already 9s
"Needs more moive:)but so far great ,also maybe idea button English moives then thier different button for different type moive or ur language just idea since u don't have that option & also let us see other country moive for thier moive on Netflix would be great to pick English or whatever language we want see for that state or country or out of the USA for them thxs idea nothing bad to say for the app or service just need moive is needed more of though"
Observed small issue ...audio langauge changes automatically after every resume of content.
"Diluting young minds by feeding film's & show's filled with sex, violence, drugs etc......"
I enjoy it it's just that u take out movies like train to busan and spiderman pls add them back.
Screen Mirroring Problems 2 star for not supporting screen mirroring in any TV whether old or new i have premium plan plz focus on this. This will help a lot to which who don't have Netflix support on their TV.
This Is awesome But When I Go to the search option it show's many adult's movies
I don't know but since the update that when I go back 10 seconds or ahead 10 seconds sometimes the video freezes but I still hear the show or movie
Cock and ball borture
Needed more cinema like mubi have
One thing I don't like is that the app doesn't switch to landscape view until it shows a video.
I luved it till they removed my fave childhood show.....can you please readd fosters home for imaginary friends.....I grew up with it and can't find it anywhere else that won't require a membership
"app is great but one problem, PUT THE HARRY POTTER FILMS BACK ON PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYONE IN QUARANTINE AND SCHOOL HOLIDAYS"
The amount to whatch is amazing but it gets pretty boring
I love Netfiix but its not leting me go to kids for my twin girls mabie its my inernet. My kids has been waching Youtube (cookie swerl ) i love it but...i hate it.ðŸ˜£
Need more movies. Older like 1980's
"What the hell....if I'm watching any bollywood series or movie in hindi, then it doesn't always have to show me hindi subtitles whenever English sentence or English dialog comes, it's irritating...i can't even turn it of...bcoz subtitles are already of ðŸ˜‘ if i want subtitles I'll turn it on...but this unwanted subtitles i dont want, plzz fix it....i can't concentrate ok scene when subtitles pops up whenever on screen comes english sentences comes or any English dialog comes....plzz fix it"
App is not opening it stays on intial sceen
"Some of the shows they have been adding or just not something that I want to see or my kids to see.... Like the show 10 reasons and cuties.... Very disappointing that anyone would owe their child to be like that, much less making a show out of it.... SMH ðŸ™„ðŸ¤”"
Stop auto playing a different series when an episode I'm watching ends. Let me choose if i want to take in what I watched or move over to something totally new in 3 seconds. Bad user experience.
Wish their was south park
I wish there was more wicked tuna seasons
t . u
Ok I have a question Netflix!! Why can't I watch any trailers on my phone?? Every single one says not available. Plz fix this!!! It's very irritating
"Brightness setting overrides system brightness. That was a poor decision, please fix this by removing the feature or having the option to not use it in the settings. The app doesn't track progress through a show very well, especially across devices, and has trouble logging in at times. Seems to work reasonably well otherwise."
Nice application to watch movies
So nice
Dont like the lock screen feature or the brightness bar
This app won't open. My internet is working fine but it says Network Error.
It won't work for me I don't like it as if now I might kinda like it later on in my experience
I was watching the vampire diaries and then it was removed from my Netflix. I understand why it isn't on my list but I was really hoping to have it back
Nonr
PLEASE COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH MARVEL!! I will shout it from the rooftops!! I want to be able to pop up Iron man 3 or Guardians of the Galaxy were ever I can go!! Is it the fact that only Spiderman movies are semi related to Marvel and semi related to Sony that it's on Netflix!?!? This is ridiculous!!
You sould add movies that you can onley get freom sinamer
Always showing too many login attempts
It's good however it could use a refresh button of sort to erase all unwanted movies
It's great. Better than good. Not yet amazing. It struggled with ubiquity and it's repetitive while searching. It loves new and frankly that's not always better.
It's ok it doesn't have that much show that i want to watch but it's great
Well it's good but it would be nice for once if you put Audio in spanish for american horror story.
The video and audio are not in sync
It keeps forgetting where I'm up to. Starting from previous episodes
English
"Please upload ""365 days"" characters pictures for profile display"
Not playing on my tablet.. Erroring...
Great
Awesome just cant cast frome my iphone
Buggy. When you enable then disable subtitles the progress bar freezes but the video carries on playing.
Make it easier to rewatch a series
Agora ta tudo muito bom a Netflix arrumou os bugs amei
"Is there anything wrong? Netflix from Samsung Galaxy S9+ not loading, only shoeing Netflix logo and that's it."
The app is not longer registering the place even if I make sure to press the back to menu button. It's also needing work to not skip ahead to the most recent season. If I finish season 1 I want to watch season 2 not season 8. Gratitude.
Ummm Im Only Giving It Three Star Bcs It Freezes A Lot
I'm suffering all data and information in Spanish Can it be in English
Was good but now app give black screen. Can only watch in minimized window
I gave the app three stars not because I don't like it but it doesn't have most of the movies.Other than that the app is great.so please if you can make some adjustments we would appreciate and thanks for the wonderful app.I understand if it is a policy but everybody pays the same amount of money to watch but some of us don't get the movies we want or search for . please try and fix the issue please
Sometimes better than cable.
"Netflux on my ohone doesnt stop playingvafter 3/4 episodes. When I fall asleep while netflix is playing, it just continues throughout the whole night ðŸ™"
"Over the last 3 weeks, I have to uninstall Netflix app and reinstall on my Huawei tablet which is very unsatisfactory as I cannot access anything when I log onto Netflix."
"I love Netflix because there are NO commercials however they took Andy Griffith off, now the only thing I can watch are action shows or reality shows etc. Some of us like and Want the old school clean shows no sex no violence no swearing . Put The Andy Griffith Show back on!!!!"
It is good but unfortunately does not have the series I want to watch
"Netflix is brilliant but I'm unable to watch a lot of movies on my fone, I can hear it, see the subtitles but not the movie, screen is blank. I don't have this problem on my tablet. Do I need to download something ? It's very annoying"
Netflix is a great way to watch movies and shows. I just wish it had more titles to watch and more profiles.
You used to be able to exit out of the app and still have a window playing on Android but after the most recent update there's just a notification to click to go back to the show/movie. It was my favorite feature over Hulu..oh well ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸
Episodes used to resume where it stopped. Now I have to skip 3/4 episodes to get back on track.
its a error OMGS ITS A ERROR CODE
I was going to watch netflix movie om rave with my friends and it was keep sighing out
Recently I have updated my app and it's works worst I m neither able to download my video nor the videos play from the point it left
"It doesn't save where you left off in a show which is highly annoying. It used to but the last couple of weeks it has not. Otherwise, somewhat decent app."
Could not get it to load...
Good
Well it will be a little bit odd ...but its worst for anime
You can watch stuff
Ok naman sya
"Netflix has Maximum number of Best Movies BUT PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN'T FIND ALL MOVIES LIST IN APP, ONLY FEW MOVIE NAMES ARE SHOWN IN LISTS DUE TO THIS PROBLEM MOST OF MOVIES REMAIN UNWATCHED, PLEASE PLEASE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™"
It's great
The background battery drain is insane.
"Thanks for enabling full screen on phones (allowing notch to cut into content). Now I want you to copy mx player's approach with the fit to screen, crop and 100% (it has an icon in the bottom row in the player to switch between these sizes) . They have stretch but that distorts content, so don't want that"
"The picture is TOO DARK. Even with eh built in brightness control, it's too damn dark. I never had a problem with using the brightness built into my phone, but since you. Added it to the app, it has been ruining whatever I watch because the app setting throttles the brightness down. Remove the setting all together. It was never a problem before. Ever heard ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it?"" No app should override phone settings."
When i sign in it keeps on getting log out and I can't login again even when i don't change my password Why????
You have to improve the search option.
Great app but its unreliable to watch an episode properly without it being frozen for no reason.
Hey Netflix. I tried logging in with a valid shared ID from my cousin. Everytime I try to login it shows incorrect email or password. Kindly help me out in this regard.
Wonderlful app
bugs.
I love netflix. But they need to fix the bugs. The episode or movie I watch keeps freezing so have to go out and back in or restart my device. It's getting pretty annoying. Otherwise great app.
Wow
Worst
"Riddled with foreign movies. I never watch movies with subtitles, so it would be nice to opt out"

Previously it was 4 stars. Now the app keeps giving errors.

Please add some more bollywood movies

"Give us another payment method like google pay, phone pay, paytm or rupay or paypal!who have not this kind up debit or credit card they cant subscribe netflix !Very disappointment!"
so nice
"Well, its okay and some movies/shows are okay but, i get bored from a lot of them. Netflix you have a moive called ""cuties"". And its basically sexualizing children in there and, i dont understand why that movie is out for people too see. Like as if pedophiles wont love that..."
Its not avalable in my country ... please if u work on that i will be verry happy
Hard to control what I want to see or remove from my list
Could have a confirmation message before cancelling/deleting downloads to prevent accidental deletion. Would also benefit a comment section so we see other people's opinion about the show/movie.
Recently in my phone i can see only subtitles and the screen is black... It sucks!
Content doesn't play in HD
Good but web series are more than the movies
"Plz put game of thrones in the list, that will be honor."
Too much old series..is any new series in sci-fi please upload it....
"This app doesn't seem to play nice with Chrome OS. It can't remember where I paused or exited, and restarts a series I'm watching at different previous paused points within the series. Amazon Prime and HBO streaming do not have this issue. So I tend to use those streaming services more often, even if I'm interested in Netflix's programming."
I got Netflix for years seems like they always adding same movies dont see nothing new they need to do something about it!
It buffers constantly
Inappropriate
not bad very good but more shows and faster
Audio video sync issue on forwarding
"Arabic Subtitles are not accurate at all, it will change the actual meaning entirely. Please fix"
The app keeps shutting down or placing the same stupid message that there's an error requiring a reset of the or app. Fix it already.
Do not have the better series
It is good but not greatðŸ‘
pretty good.. just hate some shows that are left unfinished... and for this reason alone yet there are others but never you mind... i am finished with netflix... too much time... on it... which takes you away from reality... which is fun also.. just need to find where to look... the search is the hard part... so have fun... in the virtual world and the real world.
I have used Netflix forever and aside from them letting go of some really good originals to make less entertaining shows it is a really good app.
Love Netflix...but could you please make it optimised for Samsung Dex?
It is good but one day my tv shows went missing
"Good movies are gone, bad movies are staying"
It's incredibly hard to read the subtitles when I'm watching subbed anime it would be great if you included some sort of customisation for the subtitles
Lack of movies
Upgrade your content. Many old shows aren't available. Suggestions don't match with the queries.

"Thus app is nice but it dose not let you watch offline without downloading , I will like every one to download , if u like watching movies similarly serials and etc i would suggest Netfilx and Prime video followed with Hostar Please replay"
Bahut mehenga hain bhai
Why it isn't work
"it's actually good however i really can't take screenshots, but my old phone can. and also can ypu please add the ""italic bold"" font on netflix? many users suggest/love this font so can you add this??"
Good and very nice
"THANK YOU FOR ADDING The Profile Lock ØŒ We want same shows you are giving to USA Netflix most of the show's and movies is missing not available in Bahrain very disappointing paying this amount of money and not getting all the show's is very disappointing , you need to be fair with all users around the world you can't just include what you want without giving all the people the same experience that USA Netflix owners have shameful"
Netflix needs to due updates on their series shows....some shows are on season 7 while we are watching season 3....this is the only problem I have other then that great app!
3 stars as its not remembering the last episode played and goes back 3 or 4 episodes when you return
this app a lot of digusting things so i vote this 2 stars but it is good for kids it has all cartoons for kids so 3 stars is ok
Plz add marvel... it sucks because we all need marvel plzzzzzz
Nice
Needs more shows and nedds to allow a comment section under each show so netflix can immediately receive there subsbriber coplaints or reviews
"Hey guys I knew you guys are doing good job but coming straight to the point whenever I watch a movie or series I see there is a lag between the scenes and voice either video plays ahead before voice or vice-versa I had to close video and open it again to watch properly , one more if I click on forward video then it is stuck for 5 second again I had to reply it hope you will fix this in upcoming build"
you dont really call on me like you should link up i roll thru the hood problems but everythings all good my love
While playing downloaded videos error 2.119 is showing and videos are not playing. Fix this please.
ðŸ˜Ž
Cancel cuties
Too slow
I like it
It's really good but they need to add pokemon xyz and others
The Download speed is very poor plse fix this issue
I love this app its just they dont give all of the seasons for any anime even though these animes are over 8 years old ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º
its a great resource to watch movies and shows but they should add more.
Everything is perfect all subtitles movies and the quality is excellent the only thing Netflix needs to be more good is more options for movies there are only a few movies and I can't seem to find any interesting ones since all of them are baby movies!
U have almost every show u could ever want on just one platform
Why did they cancel the society season 2 why can't they have better movies though ugh but also glad that they don't have ads like hulu ðŸ˜‚
Its an okay app but i have started to watch stranger things and i save to my playlist thingy and when i tried to go back an watch it.GONE.
Nice I like it but I wish that there was more proper age ratings
They shouldnt get rid of films that are a bit old ex|iron man so thats why im taking away 2 stars
Good
"I really like this app very much, I had no problem till the past week each time I open the app they said sorry can't reach Netflix (-14) and is always appearing each time I open the app , so I keep on uninstalling and installing but still it keeps appearing so I have deleted the app"

You should update the anime plz
Good app
"I love Netflix and have had it for a few years now. But, they suck on keeping up with content. They never add anything new until the last minute, and its all usually never anything good. Even the old movie that they add aren't good. They never keep up with any of the series. It's always a year or more behind actual TV and any other TV platform."
"Hey team, the app was great before two updates, I was able to continue a show from where I left, but now it's messed up, everytime I get back to the app, the resume would be two episodes old from the actual one. Please fix this"
Yay
Box office
Good but the payment should also be done by upi
Ever since the update I have not been able to enter Netflix and it is annoying PLEASE FIX IT !!
"There's a bug in the app. If you press home while streaming the video player turns into a pop out, when you click in the centre and expand to go back to the content, features like lock, subtitles etc are no where to be found"
Waste of time
Sometimes it has a probleme but is realy good
I would love more animes or horrorn movies for the german server.
"I like the app, but it can't seem to remember where I last stopped watching. That's really inconvenient."
How come the Netflix home screen doesn't update where I left off until I completely close app
Good

Please add Rupay Debit Card Option
There is only one issue you should upgrade your plan policy from months to yearly subscription
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH ANIME and that is why it is so trash and I want to delete it
Please give me pokemon journeys and the avengers movies its the reason why I signed up in the first place. I like the series that you provide but my sole motivation why enrolled to Netflix is watch those. I'll give 5 stars if you give me those.
I haven't used it before
It takes me long to find a show to watch but I will give it 3 bcz the shows were very good
Love it
Please include rupay card for payment in india.
Can't open the app anymore from old andtoid version.
it wont play it says please log into netflix or error
"Netflix movie's seem to stay the same, even from one theme to the next. Take cues from our movie/show queries, when we can't find what we're looking for. I'm tired of coming up with... ""TITLES RELATED TO"" ......"
It is very easy to use. I love how i can easily manipulate the episodes/movies. And i discovered many more movies! ðŸ‘ but... Its so hard to sign in
"Cool and innovative app. This is intellectual property I want 5000 KWD for it, why can we leave a comment or review after we watch a movie ðŸŽ¦ or series even a documentary."
Nn us the
everytime i open up it says 1023 error somthing and i tried to rest it again and again but it dosent work.
hard to find movie that i type..
Netflix what happen? Can't open your App I've been encountering errors everytime to Open it. -1023 please fix it. Ever since it was updated been having hard time Opening it always shows an Error.
The app is better than the content. I think the reason why Netflix doesn't provide any decent search/sort/filter capability is because then subscribers would see just how little decent content there is.
"Video quality, subtitles, interface, they are all good. Even shows are good. But some of them have scenes cut out of them. Like Friends. A lot of scenes unnecessarily cut out. Don't know whether you do it just to reduce the time of the episodes or any other reason, but it's actually very much annoying."
I would like to say that we can't afford to pay for Netflix so maybe you should have no cost to it
Haven't used it yet
love this app its the best omg cyan look sus tho
It was working fine for years but now everytime I try to watch something I get 30 seconds in and the screen freezes but the audio still plays idk what the prob is
"It was great until the latest update. Now it doesn't remember where i last stopped and i have to skip ahead a couple of episodes ahead to find where i left off. Very irritating, please fix immediately"
Want an option to select video quality like other top streaming sites /apps
"gatau sih bagus apa ga, gue gada duit jadi ga gue pake"
"SUBTITLE service is TERRIBLE. One ""movie"" (The Take) has multiple places they are speaking French & captions stopped. Confirmed on S9, S2Tablet, computer, & Roku. Hey YOU CHEAP dumasses at Netflix, I PAY YOU, so: DO YOUR JOB."
I had better with show box
"Untill reboot due to my ignorance,i give it 3.75 low cause everything else Google downloaded not my paid up account/ restart all over cloud has holes"
"Ehh it's okay I guess, I think it would be better if for each account you could restrict/take off certain genres like horror or action or romance, bc I get scared really easily and I'm tired of seeing Venom or NUN every time I open netflix."
Needs better compatiblity
"Most of the time, when I try to open Netflix, I m greeted with an error 1023 and I am unable to access Netflix, this happening frequently nowadays."
I'd like to do a documentary on all the documentaries that were done on Netflix good documentaries but they charged us for a free trial and wouldn't reimburse it kind of bad on the customer service

"Great app, but there is no email notification for when the password is changed. My brother's account kept getting hacked and his password changed but he didn't get an email notifying him. In this era, this shouldn't be lacking in a paid service. That was disappointing."

It's great but I would love it even more with dragon ball series and movies on it

"It's fine. Casting sometimes connects to my Xbox quickly, sometimes not at all. On Google pixel 3, with new gestures, PIP with netflix can no longer be used. Swiping up from a video that is playing takes me to my home screen without activating PIP. As of this review, youtube app does not have this PIP issue with the latest gestures."
I love this app but i really want they to add fast and furious tokyo drift Please add this movie to the app please add the movie because i really want to watch the movie
For some resson it always says there are ads but its netflix so why are there adds
Good but video player has got some bugs..... Please optimize it's functionality
The Indian version of Netflix does not have some shows that are in US which is disappointing. Also the quality of downloads on mobile is not too great even though I have a good wifi.
It ok just... You need to add more shows i like anime but you dont have that much anime like my favoite anime you dont have i can just go on hulu.
Where is the famous movie JOKER 2019? Please add it.....
"Hello Dev team! I'm experiencing a terrible bug... Whenever I pause and then try to play the play button can't be tapped ðŸ˜“ then I've to tap on the 10 sec back button to play again. I'm using Nokia 6.1, please fix this...."
"Good to see it's getting affordable, please include trailers to as many movies as possible.. That's the only annoyance for now, movies are playing from the start as against from where it was paused after today's update (Maudie) is the movie name, please resolve, not sure yet if this is with other movies too."

Bad
Good
I would have put in 5 stars but I was disappointed that crimnal minds didn't have the last 3 seasons and my family and friends were looking forward to finsh the show they should really add the last 3 seasons
Need a better way to log in to your account on a TV/Blueray player instead of having to use your remote to type all your stuff in. Something similar to what Hulu Plus has.
Not happy netflix NZ. Was halfway through pretty little liars and it's disappeared. No warning.
Not enough original movies
I didnt find the vikings on netflix thats why i cant able to do 5 star Some of my friend they watched it but i didnt get the series
Very good
The videos are all black in my phone (g8 power)
Can you add 'list of movie that had been watching' by any kinds of your wish? At least we can go back to know our history. Thank you for implemented this suggestion.
"I really feel like there should be more privilege for the people paying 799 , and one more thing I think you should give us the same content u give to your US customers."
It's a good app and definitely lives up to the standard/premium name but the only problem is that I'm watching an anime and it has 4 seasons but they've only put 2 seasons on Netflix along with a few series and it's annoying because then I have to find a streaming website that will get that up for me. it's a bit annoying and I hope this will be fixed.
Not gay enough
I would like if there was a Baden that you could push and you get to pick your language with all your languages because some of them has only English and some has no English
So anytime i go on Netflix it just kicks me out and sometimes randomly freezes. I already check connections and everything on my phone. Everything else works fine. I tryed uninstall and reinstall it but that didnt fix the problem either.
Although it is said to be one multiple platforms/devices its still not able to work on all phones
TV is better off isssssss betttttttttteeeeeeeÃ¨Ã¨errrrrrrrrrrr Ty
Lack optiom to select what pixel i want to play... Lacking malayalam movies
When you watch an episode fully and you exit it comes backs to old episodes ....this is really bad...fix it Netflix
"For Chromecast the option to seek 10 seconds further or 30 seconds is absolutely necessary. Why exactly is it missing? I mean there's 30 seconds to seek previous scenes but no option to forward? The app and web version of Netflix has it but why not for the chromecast? every other streaming service offers this option but for a huge company as Netflix, why is it missing ? Is it on purpose to piss of your customers ? Seeking through the progress bar is pain in the a**. Hoping for a fix!"
"Its good enough , until I tried to cast my phone Netflix to my Smart TV, then to my projector and then my laptop , and in all , some movies will not show. I use smartview from a Samsung A31 to Hp laptop, yet all I get is a blank screen with the subtitles and al other function tabs showing but not f he video . Even while its showing fine on my phone but not on the screen it is cast to. All other things show ok until i play a movie, I get sound but no video ."

Eh needs more anime
Ever since i updated the app I'm having this problem when i press resume it plays at random episode which i have already watched instead of where i left please fix this it's very irritating
"These days Netflix is not able to update the recent episode I watched, it goes back and start the episode I have already watched. It ignores the current status of my watch list."
why can't I change my payment method?? :((( i badly need to change it but why does it always go error :-((
The updated app has lots of bugs to take care of. The show's won't start from where I left it and if I try to fast forward it gets stuck. Pls fix it.
This is a good streaming service. But I would not recommend this if you want to watch a show full season. Because sometimes the show does not have all the seasons. And it is not that updated. I hope they would update some shows so that the seasons of the shows are up to date currently.
Everything is good except you offoine download system What the heck is wrong with it man It stops automatically as the screen goes off And its really really poor man Just do somethin about it
How do i close my account with you money was debited on my account while i dont even use netflix i need to cancel pls. if

Took awhile to load
Needs more shows
Great!
"It's a good platform for watching movies, but they often disappoint. Many times they don't have certain seasons from a show and more recently they have released a shockingly disturbing movie which nobody supports or likes yet Netflix resuses to remove it from their platform even though it is offending many people."
Good
"Currently having trouble connecting to netflix, error message said it cannot reach the netflix service and need to restart. I needed to restart my phone to fix it. The problem is after a while the error appear again. I'm having this problem for a week now.."
"As an app, works pretty much flawlessly (albeit some settings are still web-only and not accessible in app). As the service goes, ymmv. As long as you're not looking for a specific movie, there's plenty to kill time."
"Good app I just gave it a 3 star because they don't really have anime shows like my hero academia, blood C, or darangopa. I will like that if you add those shows. And there's a problem, when I'm finish with a episode and go to the next episode. I left netflix and got back to netflix and It got back to episode 1. I don't know if it's a glitch but please fix it"
"What's with all the foreign language movies? If I set my preferences to English, I want to watch English movies. Is it because Netflix is cheapskate and these movies are cheap to show in other countries? Not such great content once you've watched the few blockbuster movies"
What is the wrong with the latest update....it's not working properly...it's just loading and loading and loading....it's like never gonna start the video...
Worked perfect until update to Android 11. Unable to login or open now. Hope fix won't take long
Old faebook

Extremely pissed that I can not Watch the Vampire Diaries in SA. that show is the reason i have netflix in tje 1st place.
Great
"Every time I open the app, I'm greeted with a 1023 error code saying it couldn't reach netflix. My internet connection has nothing to do with it. I close the app , open it again and it works, but it's annoying after a few hundred times. I want to browse more titles but the UI is confusing. I want a section specifically for genres. There are times when I change the language of a title, the subtitles will also change, to a language that I didn't intend to change to."
"Well my app doesn't work sometimes it won't even load up but let's talk about your movie, tv show selections. You guys have taken off some of the best shows and movies since that you had before 2016. Alot where kid movies that where actually really good like spooky buddies and treasure buddies and my sisters keep and other movies and tv that I feel you should bring some back. Bring back your older sections for awhile. There's barely anything for us teens and young adults to watch that we enjoy."
it lags sometimes while scrolling through the app
Very Good
Because not recharge in the NETFLIX
Good I'm enjoy it
Good
I gave 1 star bcoz ladies like us who are housewife and dont use any cards can't watch Netflix. Can't you make it simple by just letting us sign up and enjoy ur channel. I hope you take this step so that it will b easy for everyone who are not using cards as some people are having cards but are not ready to use.
Aha
Netflix app has been having some issues lately. The screen freezes and it's pixelated with green images. The sound is fine though just the videos looks corrupted on every show I try to watch.
"This is a great app, but it is not made for kids.. Please make ""NETFLIX KIDS"" So they could watch Kids cartoons or tv shows which is made for kids. Being a kid i reviewed this app. Love you NETFLIX."
One year pack not available
Hmmm... It's good but sometimes when i open tha app the series that i want to continue has just gone and then a few hours later it's already there again... And it's just keep on happening
Hahhahah
Nice
Its good
videos download rate is slow..even slower than hotstar
Its a very great app i love the movies but i dont like how one of the shows disappear. Can you please fix it cause its annoying when you just watch a show then you like it but the after 2 days its gone. It would be a pleasure if you fixed it. â¤ï¸ðŸ˜Š
You can't use 5 device with same account same time...
I don't use because no subscribe I don't have money
Best for watching series ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
Movies are good but i can't log in to my account and it keeps saying wrong password
"Worse with every update, same as most things. Newest update now has ""Watch what other people watched after *blank*"" as a whole row, but its almost every row! Out of 44 rows, 14 were the as above stated ""Watch because somebody liked it"". Not 1 was recommended for "" Me"". And the UI is in the same boat, worse every update."
I stop watching movies Netflix for a month now since i was writing my final exams but when i ressume My netflix cannot even open.Its tell me I should choose from an account save with Google smart lock.please kindly help me out to open to Netflix.
Netflix I love you but seriously dude if you're gonna put shows on there put ALL the series not give us like 2 then leave us to find the rest.
Picture in picture on Android 11 with Pixel 4 XL has stopped working
Shows are awesome. But I'm having problems with sounds. Video is playing but there's no sound. I tried to do everything. updating to chack sound system. Sometimes i have to restart my phone to watch shows with sound. Please resolve this situation.
Best app but just in english language no other.
Good
Not many options anymore
"I'll cut to the chase. I dropped 2 stars because of the fact that there is no feature to tag a film or series with 'Do not show me this.' , surely out of all the people that have been using Netflix, one of them must have suggested it. Why has it not been implemented? This feature would save you're viewers a lot of frustration when looking for something to watch. Seriously, add the feature."
The show I am watching is not popping up no more
The app runs the shows I watch smoothly. The only issue that's quite annoying to deal with is that it's not saving the spot where I last watched. Either the video starts at the beginning of the episode or sometimes I need to flip two episodes ahead to find my spot. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.
Nice. But wish it was easier to find shows. Most of the recommendations are all the same
"Picture plays clearly, but I spend more time trying to figure out how to get error messages to go away and get the app to run than actually watching my shows. I never have this problem watching on my PC or TV, and it's very disappointing not to have a working mobile option."
"If I have a movie (for example) download on my phone, and I Miracst it onto the TV. Does it use data when playing on the TV - even if it's already been downloaded?"
Was Great until today. All of a sudden the netfix app no longer working on my device. When i login it wont go past the maine netflix black screen with the red netflix logo and then after about 5 minutes gives an error message saying we can not reach netflix service. Please try again later.(-9)
"I love Netflix and all but I really wanna watch Ninjago season 10,11,12, and 13 cuz it stop on Netflix at season 9 so pls add more seasons to it and I might bump the rating to 5 stars pls add."

Its okay. But tell me why it struggle to keep the streamed video on 360p while other site effortlessly can run on 1080p?
"Great channel, only problem is the series are way behind."
It's an amazing app but I have to keep on deleting it beacuse of an error but Netflix has amazing shows I would recommend Teen Wolf it is very good
"Some times the screen goes off without any reasons. I talked to the customer care about this. They told me it was my device's fault, but thats not the case i tried with other devices still same. I have to restart my device to fix this issue. It is irritating."
Search engine is crappy
"Fix your goddamn bugs , Netflix. Everytime i continue to watch a movie or an episode , the screen turns black, the audio corrupts for some reason, and evertime i close the app, the same problem happens again over and over. It's annoying. Fix it."
I recently updated my payment and now the app does not work. Can't get past the first logo screen and it suddenly stops. If there is any problem please fix it or else give our money back
Needs more features
I got netflix on my tv and its not loading. Only a black screen shows up everytime I open it on the television. I tried casting a movie from my phone but it just says error. Pls. Fix this cause my mom loves watching movies
Ok
Why download cannot save in gallery?
"New update cause crash, error 5.10 all the time"
I had some issues ðŸ˜” because I can't download the movies ðŸ˜£
"Sure yeah its a great app i like watching anime on it, but the annoying thing is that picture this. Your watching adventure time and on ep 11 then you come back to watch it and its been removed, i really don't understand the point on posting a movie or tv show and then removing it after like a month either way netflix is 'okay'."
"Yeah sure ,it is absolutely great thing you did it but there is some technical issues , when I was watching the movie or series at the time I attended calls and after I couldn't watch the movies there is no visuals but I can hear voices and bgm. What did you there ? I need a brief answer. I loved it so you must have clear it for the better experiences."
"Picture in picture mode does not work on Android 11, even when it's allowed in settings. The continue watching list does not automatically update to the last watched episode/time. Instead, it remains a few episodes behind."
Honestly it's good however it just is a black screen for the most part for me.

"I couldnt found the documentary of Vietnam war Ken burns... Once it was there.. I couldnt finish all episodes, im compelled to watch it on dailymotion.. I feel like cheated. 3stars for just User interface."
"I'd normally say this app is great but lately the continue watching section changes constantly and now since the update, nothing is ever bright enough. I have my phone and the app brightened all the way and it's still dim"
When the tv show is ending it will start to buffer even its downloaded.
Every thing is good in the app except for the below: 1. Would love to have a option to control quality of video while watching. 2. The loved the feature to play the videos over other apps. Why remove it????(reduced the rating one point) :(
"I've enjoyed watching Netflix for many years. But the way they're going just isn't it. Like cuties??? Sorry Netflix but what we're you thinking?? Also the new kissing booth movie just wasn't it. Not funny, , not a laugh, not a chuckle, not a haha, not a hehe. Maybe start working actually good shows with representation instead of stealing stuff from WATTPAD. Like you really canceled the best shows for a fanfiction? I have to laugh. I will be unsubscribing xoxo"
I have been facing this problem for a long time now...the screen keeps on glitching making it very difficult for me to watch anything. Previously this use to happen only 2 or 3 times a day but now it has become an everyday thing. I am not able to watch a single episode now. Please help!!!!

"I use it mainly for the Anime content but it falls behind to update good shows and ongoing episodes which is accessible outside Netflix, also noticed while it works perfectly on Chrome but is very sluggish in Firefox (used at 50 Mbps connection on latest version of both browsers) Finally if only it could improve on the Chromecast feature(or at least roll back to its previous version) - it just doesn't show the casting option sometimes despite being connected to same stable network with TV.."
The app is cool and has made the pandemic more interesting but I think more language options should be added
The windows Store app has very limited functionality compared to android and apple
It's ok but it doesn't always play right through it freezes and then you have to go out and come back into it especially if you have stopped and trying to watch it on your phone through your TV
Equal.
Need to add live sports pls!
App is not responding after android 11 update. Kindly look into it.
"The movies are great. But problem is, the movies i downloaded cannot be played. It's a waste of internet data. I downloaded movies so that I can watch inside our house, then it says, There is a problem playing the video. Please try again. (2.119). What a bummer. If I clear the storage, it would mean the movies I downloaded will be gone. Fix it please. I even updated the latest version of the app."
It is the bad move app in the world
Buy the full sessoins of pokemon sun and moon and buy pokemon sword and shield

I like the fact that this app doesnt have billions of ads like huuluu and that there is plenty of diffrent content but i dont agree with some of their recent show and movie choices
Why is shows we use to binge watch disappear from Netflix? Geez bring it back. The 70s show is a must. LOL
Everything is fine but There are not much payment options available in india.
Good
"Put the original ""Silent Hill"" Back on Netflix. stop taking it down."

"It's very good, but it needs some more films and series.Like the Babysitter Club, it needs more episodes."
NETFLIX is good but needs more movies also needs to add the first movie and then add the 2nd and 3rs instead of adding the 2nd and 3rd ones instead

"I don't know and can't comprehend why there is so much region restricted content. Like you're paying the full price but the catalog of shows is like half of those of America's, Australia's, etc."
Good
"It's nice,really nice...But why does scarlet heart ryeo not in netflix?It's hard to find a website to watch it.Please add Scarlet Heart in netflix,everyone will like it."
Great app just wish they showed all the seasons of the shows they have

"Nice series and good films are available, but the app is worst. If you stop/pause the running video and came back it will play from the beginning,for the series, it will play from the beginning of previous episode. Not a user friendly App."
Need better scary movies
You should really have a A-Z list of all the content you have on the app itself. So users can go through and add stuff to their list.
"Only a couple of gripes. When swiping through ""my list"" and I go into a title to remove it from the list and go back out it scrolls automatically back to the front of the list. It's a real pain. Also please add an option to turn off auto play of previews in the coming soon section. Would be 5 stars other than that."
Same shows all the time
It ok
"Really nice app, but anytime i click out of netfix to do something else then click back in, it takes me back to the beginning of a show. Its very annoying. I tried to find the ""report a problem"" button but never found one."
Not bad
"I would give 5 stars but i didnt becz it doesnt have captain america civil war ,, game of thrones and some stuffs"

"I just cant create a new account whenever I put my email address it just shows that I already have signed in , but I want to create a new account though I have an older one that is cancelled."
No latest things or interesting shows faÄºls behind but still has my support for it to be great in future
Lookimg for a program can't figure out where to locate it there is no search to find program does have all the programs I watch on my tv? I'm watching Cold Case Files. Help please.
It has a lot of nostalgia shows and not a lot of new releases. It cant really act as my main source of television because of that. Lately the app has been really terrible at saving your place. I keep being jumped back to the start of an episode or even back half a season.
"I love this app, although very randomly it skips like it needs to buffer. Very aggravating at times, please fix! Three stars and I'm being generous with the third."
We pay the same price for Netflix as everyone else yet we don't get all the shows because we live in the Caribbean
Im sorry Netflix but you have to finish ading all the season to animes because some of us like some animes like hunter x hunter but you dont have all the episodes wich makes me sad because you dont have all the episodes and i have to go to other Apps to finish the series and I dont think that you are benifiting from it i would give you a 4/5 but its to much
RO g afternoon 2Wynn re4y
Great app
Nice app but still many collection of movies are missing
Just right
Thx
"The screen darkens where I can barley see anything, then I have to uninstall/reinstall to get it to come back. Swiping left or right only worked one time. Please fix this. Otherwise the app is great"
I have came across the error to several times. I have found that is the app. Uninstall the app and reinstall it and you shouldn't get the error any more
Need more new movie
More shows
Lack of management features and user control
Bbbbt g
"Uninstalled: app is good, but too many notifications each day. Add an opt-out option."
"Great app. Love the suggested shows and even some of the documentaries! Except sometimes when I try to open the app, my phone suddenly turns off."
"weird bug when tracking 10 seconds forward or backwards. the audio seems to get out of sync I'll reconsider the rating based on how quick you resolve this issue, its been going on for 4 months since the last update"
Good x but shouldn't payðŸ™„ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’–
Love Netflix but I think you have a bug you need to fix. It has started showing shows from the beginning episodes and not where I left off or I can't even find it in my continue watching and I have to click on the episode I was watching and then it starts from where I left it last. Never used to be like that before.
Good
Too expensive
Awesome ecperiance but u just enable upi payment option ..please cause every time need update payment details or error
Not bad
Too many old movies
OK
You have to chose your account evrytime you restart app. Before it remberd. Search is way worse now. The old search was awesome with categoris.
"I would have rate it 5 but i have some seasonal movies which are not complete and i want to know when de next seasons wil come(flash,black lighting, supergirl, lucifer and many more)"
The episodes doesn't start where i leave. I forget which episode i was watching. It's frustrating!
Needs better collection..
"It would be great if 4 people could watch at once, instead of just two"
I can't access my own Netflix
Why has Netflix removed buddha series??
"It would be great, except I can't log in. It logs in on my computer fine, but not on the app."
ðŸ‘
I enjoy those movies but it turn me to sign in again
Its good enough!!
Its good but i hope theirs more anime.
k no naruto shippuden ðŸ˜‚
Why there is no other payment option than debit or credit card
"Your app now always says ""There is a problem playing the video. Please try again. (5.10)"" and I can't even play the videos even if I downloaded them for offline watching. Kindly fix this ASAP."
If only prepaid load inluded in payment method
"Won't update, need to uninstall then reinstall every time an update is available. It's a little niggle but a niggle none the less. Please remedy this Netflix, please."
Good
Having problems on the phone. The brightness automatically decreases and o can't see the picture
ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
Old movie only shows
Services are great but issue with app Sometimes it's crash Didn't load the app
Cool movies but don't have some latest movies that im looking for ! So far its been a good experience with this app .
More movies of horror or the sci-fi genre should be included
I want beyblade burst evolution
For
I was watchin a show called once upon a time ans south park and out of nowhere mid series the show gets removed off the app im lowkey upsetðŸ¤¦ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
I love it but THEY GOT RID OF LIKE 100 MILLION GOOD MOVIES
Awesome
Its overall good stuff to watch and things to get hooked to the only problem I have is when I go to another app while on netflix and e it off it starts the moive or episode over
Never have any good movies. Thinking about cancelling.
Why always cannot connect?
Quit gud
Cant find any good shows and cost way to much.
I am starting watching all the movies and tv shows on my tv love it . But somehow when I started watch it on my phone it goes black screen and I can't see but only I can see the subtitles.
Hello Devlopers Netflix is not working on my phone i got pre installed netflix with my new M30s i updated the app but it is showing an error of Device Failure occured. Sorry we could not reach the netflix server. Please check this and reply me as soon as posible. And also this is a new phone and i have not rooted it.
"Two issues. First, the progress through an episode is not always saved properly. If I watch half an episode then come back later and finish it, it may not save and it appears that I only watched half. The other issue is with the smart download function. I absolutely love the idea, but occasionally I finish an episode and it tries to download four or five new ones instead of just the next one. It's a problem: it fills my storage with the last one and the two download per episode messes me up."
Uh no feed
Content library was great but you soon end up searching endlessly for somthing new to watch
Just recently got an issue where Netflix forgets where in an episode I stopped on or take me back an episode entirely.
App is very good havent had a problem until now...... very good for watching alone or with the family......
I love the movies but I wish they had the last how to train your dragon hidden world
Taking bout 15 minutes to load on tv. Sometimes wont start streaming at all.
Good
Not bad But the summery they right for movies or dramas are usually never good. And there isn't a lot of Asian dramas or movies.
My video keeps freezing
"I just have a recommendation that you should consider to make the app better as you improve it over time: Its a good idea to inform the users of Netflix what movies, shows, documentaries, etc. are being removed off of the app when they open the app, including a search bar if they feel you might have removed it. You could also just make a new column when looking at settings or whatever that says ""whats being removed"", when lookin at what's being removed, they should be told when to expect it."
This is awesome but some of the things i watched last year is gone like lolirock the old boss baby movie like jeez put those back but if you dont and ima rate this one got it >:(
Netflix took my money and didn't give me the 1 month free kmt.
Great app
Wish I was rich
Breaking bad is awesome!!!!ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ rip W.W Edit: Keeps saying device failure even after i restart.
It dosent have alot of my favorite shows
Pokemon
Netflix is pretty good apart from the fact that there is How To Train Your Dragon movie 1 and How To Train Your Dragon the hidden world but where's How To Train Your Dragon movie 2ðŸ˜‘
Whever i try to play any video from my wifi connection the video isn't playing. The app is opening and showing all of the contents but it can't play any video.
Good
It always give an error
"I love Netflix but come on man, I've had enough of it. I mean seriously why don't you guys accept RuPay debit card?? it's really annoying. Like I have to be dependent on someone else, what is this behaviour man?? I mean seriously, I've been telling myself that you guys will eventually work on it and get it fixed but no, there's not a sign of you guys even thinking of letting people pay with RuPay debit card. Truly annoying dude, i take back my 5 stars and I am sure a lot of people agree with me"
In other countries the movie catalog is much bigger!!!! Why in Greece so few movies?? The same with series!!!! Also in child movies also upload the Greek language traslated.
Nice ðŸ‘Œ
Not that much interested
Unable to open this app on my one plus 7pro handset ...
Dont like the fact that my favorite movies were removed and contracts expired with my favorite movie.
Good app
Good app for all
Not a bad
Good
Youll have to lay but not ALL shows are there. Specially complete anime seasons. Like MHA there were just 3 season supposed to be 5. Aww.
Update Windows version netflix..
It freezes most of the time annoying
Good
"It's ok for the price charged.. but disappointed because I have requested titles so many times and they haven't added what I requested. My favorite movies like 'The A team' , 'scent of a woman' and 'Rush' (2013) are not available. :( Please add these movies"
à¦“à¦•à§‡
It's good but I'm trying to watch yu gi oh and on season 1 it just puts me on season 5 pls fix thx
Enjoying the app so far

After the recent update whenever I am playing something the screen goes blank and the audio keeps playing and the app just freezes.
Nice
Good
since last update episode is not starting from where i left before.
As a senior & not tech-savvy I will have to take help from a friend.
"Good but cant find great, like Terminator, Mad Max, or tv shows like the Goodies, Doctor who, Dukes of Hazzard."
Paano po passwrd po hindi ko alam
I love it.
the reason i rated it so low is beacause it never saved where i was on my movie or show
Update...stuck at 70% can't open can't delete cant update cant use....
The subtitles that I chose are gone after the update... I picked the languages again in settings and it still won't show up...
Sometimes i can't find korean drama that i have watched it and all the korean drama are missing it about 4th times doing like this.
Bring back all the good things! Like El Cuerpo del Deseo and the boondocks! They keep replacing all the good shows with ones no one will watch.
When are they going to release love alarm season 2? I need to know
Great app
Very good
ITS TRASH jk lol its good but its kind lagingg on my device
Not a big variable of movies
I live in uk so it doesnt show me alll movies but still a good app
Log on to Netflix watch movies for free
Tired of Netflix suggestions
I just updated my app and now it wont open. Should had I not updated it?
"The content is great and have no issues with the selection but the experience itself of finding the shows is absolutely horrible. It's always recommending the same shows over and over, in the multiple sections even if I haven't clicked on any of them in months. You guys need to rethink your UI as well as your algorithms. It's unfortunate because I'm convinced people miss out on great content because of it and in return you end up spending money on show and movies most will never get to see."
Unstable
"So, the app used to work until i uninstalled it, i want to log in with my account.. And it keeps crashing! What the hell caused this?!"
"The app its self is very good, but every now and then I get bugs were it won't let me watch anything"
It's weird tho
Its very good
some stuffs are not comes in my country and this sucks
Worst as far as subscription is concerned. Charges at will directly from our accounts
Nice APK
Good
easy to use..good service..bring back Daredevil
Not able to subscribe the plan
Always crashing. Damn app. My money gone..
Please for God's sake dont remove movies which are already on Netflix
4 out of 10 times audio won't play on my bluetooth ear phones.
Errors while playing on phone so much. I wish I would get what I am paying for. Either ur videos n audios are not in sync. Or videos pixilate and now new thing video doesn't play. If I am paying 6Ã— more than other apps I expect least problems here.
"Quality of audio and video is great. Too bad I am going to cancel my subscription because I disagree with Netflix airing Cuties. I'll miss Netflix, but I can't support them anymore."
Problem with app (-14)
The best
"You deduct me twice to my account, how will you give it back that extra P550 into my account??"
Enjoying
"Help me here netflix, can't get my subscription done shows eror 404. Did it for a few 30min but its saying the same thing again and again"
Can you add jojo bizarre adventure season 2?
"Need to add new shows,movies, Etc...Madagascar 3 should be on there!!!"
I entered the right password and the right email it just won't let me log in very frustrating and very sad :(
OMG
"It is showing error , while I trying to open the app everytime in Samsung M30S phone"
"I am giving this app 3 stars because they removed death note anime season 2,3,4 and i wanted to watch them"
"I'm availing Mobile Plan and I don't understand why is there an issue in downloading movie. Example, while downloading a movie suddenly it will stop and the download will continue but a different movie wc I also selected to download. It's just weird coz it looks like the app is choosing what to download first on its own. It's just kinda unfair because I previously availing Standard HD plan paying 459/month and the downloading is just fine. Is it possible to fix this? or I should pay more for it"
"O.7mud. Icmm m d did for. I. I comel, for. Do for. From from. ,, Lord LOL, lc. D I komedi click di c,lglg if u greatly ! In in."
Hindi dubbed Bollywood movies not yet more
Some movies are not there
"i wanted to try it first though, if ill be able to watch some series that i missed.. but its not allowing me for a trial.. too bad.. i guess this isnt for me.."
Nice
It's good on series but sucks on some movies the endings don't have good endings
Futangina di ako maka pag ud gud
Missing simple features that lots of media players have: 1. Up/down gesture on right side to Change volume 2. Left/right gesture to seek.
"The 10-second rewind button in Netflix on the Roku remote no longer works. Tried every possible solution. Netflix says it's Roku, Roku says it's Netflix. Unbelievable that tech giants can't sort even a simple problem like this. They have your money. Nothing more to be done."
Slow at times
It's good
Good
Ok
Old movies to binge makes me sleep. Good for the health.
"Why is the Netflix Android app continually disappearing from home screen? This is the first of the many apps on this phone, to do so. Annoying to have to repeatedly re-install it."
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee feminism stinks like turd
"Needs a better search engine, also sometimes crashes on mobile with android"
Ehh
It's very hard for me to connect to my t v
Meh
Really like netflix but today it doesn't have as much good shows these days if you had the star wars series on there I probably would have given you a 5 PLEASE GET STAR WARS SERIES ON NETFLIX MOST PEOPLE I KNOW LIKE STAR WARS
Thats wow
this app is a 24 7 movie list
"worked naturally good, cuties can die in a fire though"
I don't know why but I think the latest version has bugs coz once when I'm seeing a series it either goes back to the previous episode or way ahead
Netflix is a 79% good app to watch shows on.They should put more movies and series and they should put all movies in all continents and islands so everyone can watch there are wayy better apps that this and they charge you $0 so I basically can watch movies for free
Netflix u dont deserve my approval at the moment you canceled THE SEASON 2 THAT WAS DUE FOR THE SOCIETY IVE WAITED TO LONG. But gone make a move bout 10 yr old twerkin
You should add Valume control on screen like brightness control
"3days ago my Netflix app stopped working on my mobile, so I've been uninstalling and reinstalling it but that's not working out. Please help me fix this"
"I really enjoy Netflix i enjoyed watching movies. But I hope it will be updated and also updated for the incoming new movies , like Korean new movies, Anime movies, American movies as well as Chinese & Japanese movies. I was just suggesting ."
Never works on my TV
"netflix is a really great app to watch movies on, but every single day i come onto Netflix just to see it isn't working what is the problem? Thank you â™¡"
I would've given all 5 stars but not all seasons of a movie is posted even when available Like Riverdale
App is good but always get the error 1023. Need to always unistall updates and reintall back the updates.
Programms are good but why so many shows that are world level available that you are not showing in India? Dont become bias towards us.
On my TV Netflix series away ended when they got to Mars is there more??
The only thing i hate about netflix the most is if u have a list of downloaded things in ur phone & u want to access d info of those video from d downloads tab. u can't do that. u have to return to d home page & then check it if it recommends showing up in there 2nd search engine is worse sometimes 3rd Can't u guys put up d volume or seek bar with just tap & slide as it is for brightness(sync up with phone default brightness) 4th sometimes the download nevr pauses out of a few when downloading.
OK
it is ok i guess
Netflix is really good but we need more content in our region. That is Uganda... we have less and limited content
Good
"Can you please please upload star plus old show ""sanjivani a medical boon"" (2002 ) all episodes please"
"netflix ur nice,keep going"
Its ok
It is too much costly
"We have a Smart TV. Supposedly we do not need chromecast to run Netflix with our Google Home but it looks like we still need to buy a redundant Google Chromecast to connect thru hdmi to our smart tv. In my mind, I think this only needs a software upgrade or an update. Please enlighten. Thank you"
It's nice to watch movies and documentaries
"Very good, but there is a tendency to over feminise most movies. Other than that it's great"
Pretty good.
Please include Rupay Debit and Credit cards also for taking the membership.
Fok always down ang systems
"Will you consider using deduct mobile balance for the payment., Since I have no credit card.."
"Im giving this 3 stars because when i go in it i have lots of data it just goes slow and also this is a pretty good app because they have lots of cool movies however, theres some movies i cant watch it says its not avabilve in my country. Other then that Pretty good"
It is not free at all thats not fair It does not show even a movie without login thats why i like hotstar
Good
Okay
Why doesn't Netflix let us use the screen past the notch or punch hole cameras ðŸ˜
Sometimes its good but then it will freeze over and over and its not a problem on my end such as internet or backround could you please fix this? ALSO just barely the screen is just going black and all there is is audio
Good app but hulu is better
ðŸ˜Š
I like the shows but the only thing I don't like is it's slow
"Id give netlfix a higher rating, if they didnt add that horrid movie ""Cuties"". It represents islam horribly, and is basically feeding pedophiles. Never have i been more disgusted in my life. The movie did not get its point across at ALL."
How can i buy the movies
its alright not to much to select from.
Great
There are no harry potter movies i looked it up in google it said only available in some countries not in the philippines
"I'm eagerly waiting for the Mobile+ plan which has been launched by Netflix for Indian viewers, I would really appreciate if anyone can tell me when it will be available. The content on Netflix is good and I look forward to be a viewer with the Mobile+ plan. Thank you!"
Video freezes a horrendous amount of times to the point I just dont watch anything
"The app is good and I like it but they don't get a 5 star because most of the shows they have on the platform don't have the newer seasons. And I know it's hard to get the newest season out but on some shows they are three seasons behind or more. The last thing I think they should fix is not being able to see your password on your own account settings, like say I forgot my password and wanted to my freind it I won't want to reset it but you guys need to fix those things please. After u get 5star"
Keeps freezing (not buffering) I have to close and restart 3 times before episode ends. Please fix
Works great! Wouldn't change a thing
Keeps freezing
"In itself the app is quiet useful, unfortunately it is unstable and often doesn't work if I open it..."
This app was good at first but for some reason it just wont let me in
Why does Adventure Time contain only season 5 and 6?
I love this app ðŸ¤£
"Please go directly to page ""info"" of selected item, AS BEFORE UPDATE..."
works as expected... but too little options for such a paid service
I updated my payment but it wont let me sign in.
Netflix was fine till recently but is not casting any more from Chromecast
Learn more about Netflix
"Okay last offer, The game is stealing the better...ðŸ¤§Well it was a bit more fun to me when i doenload it again in Google 'Netflix apk' I was happy back then i think the game is still in confusing method.But i think the creator is giving it a chance to provent the changes,Like watching Babysitter like that or more like anything to mass with......But i think the game is making better and better [BUT STILL NOT REALLY GOOD] to me ;)"
à° à°¡à°¡à° à°«à°¬à°•à°ƒà°ƒà°Ÿà°Ÿà±à°ª
Not bad
I still keep getting 5:10 error
"The app is okay, but it's extremely annoying that the +/- 10 sec buttons seem to actually skip a random number between 6 and 10 instead."
Costly
App is not opening after update
Need to add more quality content at competitive cost.
Would like some.more Afrikaans movies and Boer soek n vrou season. As well as NCIS and CSI.
"In the latest release, I no longer have picture in picture option anymore :-( I'm no longer able to play games etc and have my Netflix as a small window at the side anymore"
I love Netflix and the app but my little issue with the app is that some of my downloaded series and movies tend to disappear like hours after downloading. Usually they leave a warning that so and so is going to expire in so and so time but now most of the time my stuff just vanishes without any prior warning. I hate this and I would like to know what the issue is.
"Hey! Netflix corp. Why are you so partial to your people. Well, i am from india and i am not very happy about the way you choose the tv shows that your Indian suscribers can watch. I love ""GREY'S ANATOMY"" but boom it's not available on netflix India, i love ""HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER"" but again boom it's not available on netflix India. I love watching tv shows and movies on netflix ,but if you can't provide some of the famous and excellent tv shows. Then i have to search for an other option."
Just cause there is no avatar the last airbender in my country
I like it but I need to sign in and pay money! Netflix please make it free
After last update I can't use app. It is opened and closed at once
Lot of material to watch but often feel there's no filter in quality.... u have to weed out low level material in order to find a gem of a movie or show... often feel like finding a needle in the haystack.... compared to that hot star has significantly improved the quality of material... so that u don't have to weed out useless shows n movies
slow
Its pretty amazing cause episodes can be downloaded easily too BUT why I can't I find some of the shows here plus there are some seasons of anime shows missing too
Good
Quality and content is very good but it cost much to less many countries where average income is low adjust your premuim as per country's economic condition
Will Disney's Aladdin (2019) be available on Netflix?????
"Boring, Netflix doesn't have dragon ball z. Some movies missing, latest season of blacklist missing...."
Wonderful app love it ðŸ˜
Please add options to change the video quality while streaming
Why does it not allows you to watch a season again...? Ex. A show has 3 seasons and if I want to watch season 1 again it doesnt plays..it by default selects season 3
Sometimes the app won't open. It gives me a -1023 error code(could not reach service).
Ok
Is there any issue with the app? Everything is suddenly blank and not working tried every troubleshoot steps ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¤
"I would have given 5 /5 if you guys just add a volume feature slider the same way you have a brightness slider as it makes the experience better. Apart from that the app is flawless, and one issue I face is the load time is very long, the app is suddenly unresponsive, the reason which is unknown."
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watched and download so many movie/series. For now I cant even use it bc the payment cant be accepted
Good app
please do add internet banking to update payment...
It is what it is.
only a 3 cuz i miss old movies/series such as icarly which is now gone
It's ok. I bought this because I was a big fan of pokemon! There was only indigo league and a few other great pokemon movies (including sun and moon) otherwise than that this is a great app! But please try to add more stuff for the future? Thank you! >pokemon< I hope I'm not sounding cocky or mean but please add all the seasons of all the pokemon adventures! I'll be really grateful and appreciative. Thank you for consideration. I hope you won't feel pushed!
"Its a great app. But do u want to EXPLAIN why there seems to be more foriegn movies that are either in another language or Dubbed . And the dubbing is pittiful. I dont mind subtitles but its like 2 out of 3 movies ar in foriegn languge. This is netflix USA, RIGHT?"
I would have rated it higher But For a couple of shows it and have the 1st season In sometimes when a show has more episodes like they don't show it at all like they're over have it on before and then though just take off the later episodes I'll give it a higher rating once I know the reason why they do such things. But rather than that Netflix is at all around good App. I would definitely recommended . Can you make an option in the setting to turn off the are you still watching feature
My app does not download movies through cellular metworks bro
(1) Free trial unavailable. (2) Rate system is ðŸ‘orðŸ‘Ž. This is very narrow. 5 star rating would have been apt.
Good concept but crappy shows and movies
App is good but we have only kbs please help me
"Having a difficult time finding quality programs to watch,using Netflix less and less in favor of other streaming services."
So so
Hulu fan no new shows the next day
Issues such as screen blackout for ex no video is showing . This issue needs to be fixed .
"I like netflix, but im kind of mad because they're taking everything good off. Popular shows are being taken off and it sucks."
The brightness feature is the worst!! Even the lowest is high
I'm in West Africa and instead of Credit cards and stuff like that we usually use Mobile money options for online payments. Can you please add a Mobile money payment option for Netflix users in West Africa???
after updating app my app has all gone black. despite having quality internet. i cannot use it. when i play anything it says erorr
Good
No new good films
This update 7.71.0 giving me headache when i stop watching something and close app and when i return it doesn't start from where i leave it start from anywhere i watched sometimes it even starts from previous episode its so frustrating please check it and let me know whats happening I'll change my review and back to 5 stars
It's really good but some times you don't have all the hole series which make me sad
5 554 222
Works fine on everything but my phone. I keep getting the (-1001) error and haven't been able to play anything on my phone. This is a recurring problem which used to be solved in the past by uninstalling and then reinstalling the app. It hasn't worked this time around.
Not able to see the video it goes dark not able to see anything only audio.
"Awesome, would be good to have as much as america's Netflix so I have more to watch. Sometimes netflix closes by itself when I try to open it. Besides that awesome"
I hate it Jk
I love the app but i dont like sudden changes to movies for example some disapear and some reapear also some change language. I watched one punch man like 5 times in english and suddenly its in japanese i mean sure i can change it back but it changed itself
It is a Super App but it is asking money so I didn't like
"Can you please add vertical view option??? It's frustrating that I don't want to use landscape mode sometimes and I don't have the other option available. Also, double tap to skip is fine but I prefer swipe and drag option with timecode a lot more. Many players have that option and it's an absolute pleasure to skip to the part you want."
"The app is pretty good but always when I look into the coming soon tab it freezes, or the clip takes over the whole screen and the app freezes, can't scroll and phone freezes."
Error playing shows and movies is very frustrating. Why should one have to uninstall the app and reinstall it in order to watch shows - from an app that was created to stream?
I Cant Watch My Favorite Anime And Korean Dramas
Nice
Lot of good movies and TV shows are missing in the app or are not available in the country
It is nice but also has many useless movies
Nice movies but its all late
Would update che CV k stuff and movies
Series seasons don't come in order for many series. Backwards lists and to see them in order you have to physically pick the next episode Instead of the eegular auto start
Wish play more movies that just new
"I love it but you guys need to add better movies like harry potter, coraline, and MORE DISNEY MOVIES u guys went real downfall add better movies please also harry potter isnt available in america ig ADD IT BACK please"
"The selection is okay. It has a lot of great shows, but for anime it usually doesn't have every season even when they have been out for a very long time. Also Cuties brought the rating down a star."
Would be great if netflix wasnt disgusting or made good content more often
Limited offerings
Great
it is ok so far I log in once then when I log out it says not malfunctioning I am sick n tired of it so fix it tomorrow I REPEAT FIX IT TOMORROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool
Kindly remove the 50 shades thing and the 365 thing
I installed the Oxygen OS11 Beta yesterday. And now my app isn't working. It allows me to log in. But then hangs as soon as I try to play a video.
I had the app on my phone I updated it and now I cant get back in. It's not loading anything just stays on the Netflix screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times
Variety yes.. but suits my interests 3/10. I basically want Asian dramas only... The other content isnt in my best interests. Thought by paying premium.. I would have access to unlimited Asian content but ðŸ¤·ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ I will come back much later I guess
"Love Netflix, hate the app! Please please please fix the bug when you press play on something the screen immediately goes black but the audio/subtitles works fine. It happens constantly. I've updated the app. I've exited and reopened it again. The only way to watch it is on the tiny screen at the corner of your smartphone which is pointless. It's getting on my nerves now!"
All good except recently itll tell me there's an error when i try moving to the next episode or skipping a couple seconds and brings me back to the episode before. Every. Single. Episode.
Alright app sometimes it's stupid tho
"Great app! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because there are only 2 interesting series, stranger things and Riverdale, the others are so basic and boring to watch, in fact Netflix is flooded with those, 20% of Netflix's movies are fun to watch while the 80% is super boring."
Not enough Asian historical movies
thankyou
Good
"This is a really good app but the problem with it is that there's not as many movies and shows in my country that there is in america, and it's very very annoying"
ðŸ‘
Became a weeb. Now I'm on that crunchy roll flex.
Good
I am facing a glitch .whenever i fast forward the video get stuck and only audio plays.please look into it ASAP
good app
"Some times on the iOS app the video transfer to a black screen while the sound still running.. please fix this problem Another thing : Where is the part 2 of the fifth season of Lucifer , please can't wait to see the rest of the devil detective story"
a lot of B movies or movies from a diff country with bad voice matching
Very costly i have taken your subscription
â¤
Good don't lose a lot of data bad you have had Train Your Dragon 1 and 3 but not 2 please add 2 thank you otherwise it amazing thank you
Great app
"Its aight but I'd like to see some more new movies and also them real good classics like Spy kids or Parent Trap, etc."
Good
"No options, and I can't go back to precious seasons."
"At first it was exciting to watch series and movie but later it became boring no new series (GOT)or new movie (average infinity,X-Men ).... please make sure updated new movies or series thank you"
Its great with operations. Eg no befferiing however i dont get some of the shows that is being broadcasted in amaerica and that.
Good movies
It's good but it keeps on hanging what should I do delete the app or keep on watching movies while hanging
"Netflix is entertaining and all ,but you need to release new movies and make sure what u r releasing is appropriate........unlike cuties....srsly everyone is disgusted by that movie,you could've done better"
Please provide Payment Method by Rupay Debit Card. Amazon Prime is better than you
I like this app but alot of good shows got took down so when i got it was kind of dissapointing when i was little i loved pokemon and half the series was gone
"Please, bring back ""the office"" ðŸ˜¤"
You remove the hate of my waifu just remove Cuties an straight 5 stars
Need to update your thrilling/crime solving sereis/movies list
some shows dont have all the season in the show
"This would be a really good app, except half the time I am watching shows the screen just goes black and you can hear stuff, bu you can't see anything. Also it is now saying that there was an error playing the film. Please tell me how to troubleshoot this."
Variety?
"I love Netflix,though after 4yrs of having it seams there is just not enough new decent things to watch an there are way to many movies an shows not in English.. I struggle to find stuff I havnt seen to watch."
APP crashes a lot.
Finally it's working well ðŸ˜
"Pretty good content. Original series are the best feature, and the primary value, of the app."
"Autoplay changes are frustrating. It used to wait until the end of credits, then it was 30 seconds for some shows and 60 for others. Now it's 5 seconds for everything, which makes it impossible to go back and listen to credits music. Autoplay timer should be configurable, or there should be a button to delay until after credits. Or at least make it toggleable in app so you don't have to log in via browser to change preferences."
I need new episode fate
Dope
Doesn't always keep my place in shows and movies.
"My app is crashing today. Signed me out and won't let me back in. It looks like I'm not the only one, so I'm sure the team will get onto whatever the issue is soon enough."
Need more PG and PG 13. Otherwise good experience!
Take long to load on hp computer slow app
"No regular updates on anime episodes, Amazon prime gives weekly updates.please give live updates,you are at least 20 episodes behind in most of the running animes.please update more frequently"
"It says horton hears a who is on here, so i go to watch it but then it says not available in your country.. please fix this!"
Pass week or so where I left off isn't where it starts when I come back to watch later. Annoying. Other than that it was fine
Please add support for Android automotive
"Its good app though..... but the only thing that i'm not satisfied is that you dont release the whole season of some tv series like impractical jokers, family guy.... e.t.c ... if u fix this problem it would be the best"
"Sometimes kicks me off when I'm watching a episode, goes blurry as well"
Kindly add a suggestions panel for the viewers to ask for changes in the layout or give suggestions based on their likings and also anime section can use new headings and can also include a top 10 or best animes section as well
Good
Very few movies/shows to select from. Seen most of the stuff. New stuff not available in Uganda
I like it
Movie names are not displayed in your new update. Kindly fix it
How can I fix the we could not reach the netflix service.
Good
It's crashing since I have reinstalled it. It's not opening.
its good but thay remove alot of things also thay ceap throwing ads at you
Love the app only thing is U don't have DBZ Super or any DBZ at all in the anime section at allðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜­
I think you really need to add alot of 90's movies of Hollywood and many regional language movies of India . I love some of your original contents.
Not all films are available
ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
star plus satha nibhana sathaya
Add russian language!
It's not open properly plz fix it
It could do way better.
Giving 3 star but netflix should buy more indian movies and series as well as english
It is very good the movies and show are exceptional
Please add english dub for animes! Some animes doesn't have english dub. Please add some.
Muy buena
Ok
I I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING RONG THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE MONEY
"Love it, but doesnt have any old movies"
Nice
Amazing content but there is one major glitch once u forward the movie couple of tines it the visuals get stuck and audio keeps playing until u restart the app a couple of times
Videos are getting lagged by 2 seconds
Its a great app but when my brother accidently delated it it wont let me log in back to my acct it is saved in my google but whenever i clicked it it wont even let me log in it would just bugged out im kinda disapointed this happend today
Netflix has been great apart from if I start messing with the brightness the screen will go completely black and I'll have no sound. I'll click on what I want to play and then it goes completely black after a second or two. It's not to do with the brightness being too low. Please fix this
Love the app but it does not have my little pony Equestria Girls Rainbow Rocks
It's good for time killer. Just wish the executives wouldn't sexualize children.
The app is good the collection is a way better collection but it needs to work on maturity ratings I suppose it would be like Below 7 Below 13 Below 18 Not like now the kids mode is 7+ if I am in the developers team then I must do it like the idea given above
Needs some updated movies yet. I still stop back to check if there is anything new but it's not often that there's much that is new and exciting. My worst rating is the HORROR selections! Which are my favorites to watch. That rating is only a 1â­ at most times. Keep trying to get better at what your doing and I may return more often.
Good app but you can't get emotionally invested into a show because once you do netflix will decide to cancel it and renew a show that has no diversity and no story line
"I have trouble in install , Not working"
"Netflix loses all sound...Randomly. I uninstall, install, reboot, etc...Still no sound...Frustrating!"
"Lacks stuff but overall its good...specially it has alot of anime,but arent there any BL/yaoi? I mean like theres alot of sex scenes in your movies...why not put just atleast 1-5 BL movies like 'Given' it isnt really erotic but its a BL movie,really desperate for the Movie2 of it since its rare to find..."
"Its kinda complete but not complete it lacks more....like part 2 of movies its like a cliffhanger how annoying,also arent there any disney or BL/yaoi series & movies?"
IT TAKES A MILLION YEARS TO DOWNLOAD! I give it a three bec I really like to watch on Netflix but like I said it takes so long to download...idk if it my tablet but I REALLY LIKE NETFLIX Tho pls fix this if u can ty
Cool i guess?
"Sometimes the movie freezes while the audio runs, I and have to quit the film."
A little bit hard to follow:: like where to enter AUGFREE for the extra year
Crashes to many times and half of my shows has seasons out and not on here yet
"Not working on android 5, so i cannot use it on (not excesively) old phones. On later android versions: Very few crases. Great with downloaded shows."
Its nice and all but it didnt have most of the movies i was searching for.
"CÃ³mo es posible, que para todos los usuarios no estÃ©n el mismo contenido, he buscado series y pelÃ­culas que sÃ© que estÃ¡n en Netflix, pero a mÃ­ no me aparecen. Y por Ãºltimo, por quÃ© para unos paÃ­ses habilitan nuevas temporadas antes que a otros."
Best app
Not every movie can be seen ðŸ¤¨
like a good neighbor netflix is there to entertain
"Constantly crashing, screen goes black, but audio continues"
Awesome
New update does not have picture in picture modeðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ
Good
"App not functioning properly, After watching a complete episode of a tv series and moving to the next episode, and exiting the app when you again reopen it, the app shows the same last episode that you have already watched instead it should be showing the one that is currently being watched."
Favourite
GREAT
Please update payment methods
Good
"Netflix has good content, i just wish they had more shows with black people in them. Id also recommend that they include an option to search for shows alphabetically, A-Z. I also dont like how it has different categories but with similar shows, you d find shows under 'trending now' and those same shows are under 'netflix original' and again under 'popular on Netflix' it gets annoying. It does not buffer and thats amazing, its literally like watching tv."
Very nice keeps you busy at all times..and addictive ðŸ’ž
"Payment method option should be more like upi ,netbanking"
my netflix keep crashing
Okay
Won't. Load half the time
"It's a convenient app. Variety of movies and series are available here with lots and lots of recommended kid shows. Thus, I like this one!.. UPDATE: cool app, but got bored easily. The movies are not really a lot, and series are of bland taste. ....But keep up the good work :)"
Like to get more episodes on shows that you like and change movies a little more
Ø®ÙˆØ¨Ù‡ Ø¨Ø¯ Ù†ÛŒØ³Øª
This app couldnt be any worst
Why? I didn't top up using mobile number? Answer this question thank you Netflix :)
Good
Started using Netflix how do u search for Hindi dubbed content couldn't find answer in google
Picture-in-picture no longer works after Android 11 update.
Boat app hai salo
This app is good but we want all seasons of beyblade burst
Updates every 2-3 days. Why do I need to update the app so often? I updated the app 2 days ago and you released a new update yesterday.
Ok but too costly..
"I love Netflix, the app us great. My only problem is when I suspend my subscription for a month or two they need to stop emailing 6 times a day."
Ok
Not enough animeðŸ˜­
I keep trying to Sign In but it says The password or email is incorrect even though I did it correctly after asking my family.
lack of good quality movies
Great app but doesn't always show the image on my phone.
The TV app doesn't have any option to change or reduce the video quality to lower tp reduce data usage. Too bad. Learn something from youtube. The best app on TV and moBile.
"I really like this application but why are you removing most of the Anime like Naruto shippuden,my hero academia season 4,etc?. I would really appreciate if you bring them back."
Lately when Ive been watching Netflix on my phone and I keep getting ads and there getting on my nerves why is this happening
I have to delete and redownload the app every day!ðŸ˜ 
I love this app the most. Original series of this application are fabulous and inspiring.
No Dr who anymore â˜¹ï¸
It's good
Everytime I opened app it ask me to choose my profile again. Really annoying...
"The update is bs. It always crashes, and when I resume my shows, it's not the exact time. Very pissed about the update."
Um is pokemon journeys available now ?
It's great just one punch man is not in English kinda sucks
Please add Telkomsel operator as mobile billing
No HD playback even though the device is L1 certified. On Netflix it is showing L3
Its great but a lot of stuff is not on here
Awesome
I love Netflix but ever since the last update the app doesn't resume where i stopped... it resumes at different previous episodes. Please fix!
Need new movies tired of seeing the same thing and can't ways find what I'm looking for
i like it but it took a bunch of good shows off
I think this apps is okay
"Everything on my list disappeared and I whenever I try to add some to my list, it just won't work"
"Add sailor moon with full 200 episodes and ghost stories, danganronpa, demon slayer, tokyo ghoul, AND ADD THE REST OF HUNTER X HUNTER NOOOEEEEWWWWW"
The best
My opinion on this app changes about as much as Spencer Reid's hair.
Lots of content still I vote for primevideo due to regional movies and Netflix has to think about users where they are high in India
like it but not happy with the price going up for second time. if anything it should be going down not up
A lot of speech delay
The player is crappy. Update: some of the features have been improved. Getting better.
Everytime I play the video the screen is black and I can hear the audio but I can't see it it's black. it's super annoying
Netflix has taken a bunch of the older shows off. Missess seasons and episodes. Takes away and raises membership!
"Watching Hotel Del Luna, the screen dimension for every other episode is wrong. I've ended up watching those episodes on another streaming service"
When I'm done watching a show it says I'm on the episode I was on before watching the next. First example if I was on ep12 and finished it it would say I'm still on it or it would say I'm on ep11
I am having trouble lately. The content and stuff are good. But the app itself is not good. My video freezes almost all the time. Sometimes it keeps buffering endlessly. Yes i have a great internet but Netflix is not optimised properly
Love
"The app and service itself is excellent. The only complaint I have is the selection. I get that owning rights is an issue sometimes, but at LEAST KEEP SOME OF THE OLD TITLES PLEASE!, Instead of removing them!"
It's my best app
Error 502-117 can u guys explain .......this happen many tyms pls help
Confused as to why i downloaded the app and the had to immediately update.... They are called patches people lol
The scroll function in the My List is not up to mark. Whenever I scroll down and open any of the movie or series and then go back to the list it takes me to the top of the list and I have to scroll down again. Is it just my phone or the app. Because this is really irritating.
Because other anime and many other episode of anime's still not uploaded yet.

"When we had free time we watched Netflix. I've personally Subscribed from Netflix twice. Netflix completely shook up the world. All I do is sit at home and watch Netflix. The revolution is here. It's established that Netflix is a place where you can get premium content. It's a whole new world. It's very interesting. We'll be discovering it together. Movie is growing very quickly on Netflix. Netflix best for movie service, I want to make my own Netflix originals."

Please allow us to backup Netflix data via helium backup. I have tons of downloaded seasons and some movies and I don't want to waste my time redownloading them again in my new phone. Please allow it. Thank you ðŸ˜Š.
Good apps for classroom management
Good app
there is alwayes an error.. i kept rebooting my phone ..please fix it
Every time I try to download a series it says download is full what is that
Keeps on getting 5.10 error
You can show the content for the adults in a separate part. And family and kids movies in another .
It's amazing but I am missing some hardcore ART films..
It's a good app but all the shows and movies are boring and once I find and good show like I am not okay with this or Sabrina then netflix has to cancel it I would suggest this app if u wanna watch dumb shows
Best app for movies
"I used to like it but they didn't have good shows or movies anymore and they took ""the lion in you're living room"" and that was a really good documentary. The other problem I have is that they only have some seasons of a show, like they have season 1 and 3 but not 2."
Need a split screen option. No app or cast option for MI-tv.
Why remove The 70's Show ????? I was busy watching that...
Please change that feature where it gives micro description of the movie/show and if we have to add it to our list we have to go extra step it was better earlier where we jst tap on the show name and it gave a full screen description with add to list right in front of us
"Needs more good shows that dont use gay as a personality, also what's up with this ""cuties"" thing, seems kinda dumb of you to do this Netflix"
good
Meh
like it's Netflix. it is great to watch my shows amd movies. I downloaded it knowing it is not optimized for my device. However i would think a streaming company would ensure there product can be used by any device... it took 3 days until problems arose and i can hardly watch anything now. please do somin
"Why the app won't pick up subtitle settings I changed to get white background on black text. The change is showing on web player, but the app still is using older style Can't see what the subs are and I'm watching anime :|"

"This app has various issues on my xiaomi mi mix 3. It continuously disappears from the status bar while a show is playing which requires me to reopen the app every single time I want to eg. skip forward or pause the show. It's like it's auto closing. Another issue is that for the limited time the app is actually present in the status bar, I can't change the volume in an app. Instead it change the eg. movie volume. Primevideo has none of those annoyances."
Ini sangat bagus
"After the recent update, the video controls are not disappearing quickly. You have to wait 2-3 seconds which is frustrating. I hope this will be reverted back to it's old version..."
Why is the screen so dark and we can't adjust the brightness more. Half of the movies and dramas we watch are so dark and not worth watching... do something about the brightness
Hindi dubbed audio cha oppsion dya pratek movie open krun bagavi lagte

Please enable Open Pop-up View for Android. Or at least make yours adjustable.
"PROBLEM.

"Netflix is the best, love the app soðŸ’– much"
"Its a great app dont get me wrong but like, its the cancelling shows with lgbt or disability representation for me"

"It's very easy to work with my chromecast, and I like watching my shows like everyone else but, I don't want to see the intros. I just want a auto-skip intro/recap settings in the app instead of going back in the app and hit the button. I know that it's a minor inconvenience but intros/recaps are the worst parts of any show"
Good
"The application usually works as advertised. But there are some issues. *September 5th, 2020* The most recent update broke the app for my Samsung S7. Now I deal with frequent infinite loading screens forcing me to restart the entire phone just to get the app to work. Also I'm getting fed up having my ""continue watching"" & ""my list"" buried & shuffled underneath 4 or 5 different categories. I want them to be the top 2 PERMANENTLY & below that new releases & below that I don't care."
Ok
Not bad
Its a good app but everytime i go into it it says there is an error and i have to sign out then log back in again
Needs more anime and less woke shows
Need rupay support for payment
Selection is good. I wish I had the ability to change how many episodes before the are you still watching block comes up. Can be very frustrating.
Limited number of movies
"Black Screen. I've tried restarting the app and everything, it just won't load my shows."
Why dont I have the same shows as everybody else?
"The app is really good, me and my husband were enjoying the app. But The new update is showing error on my phone since last 2 days. N nothing is helping to start Netflix. It's really frustrating. Can you fix it."
The app is not working on my device it's crashing continuously on the sign in page. Kindly look into the matter
You have not released naruto shippuden Englis

"About everything you'd expect from a movie streaming app, I do wish that you could fine tune brightness more, or at least allow the use of system brightness, which shows brightness percentage and where I can use night mode."
Ever wonder why there isn't more Native American movies on Netflix they have a black cinema Category but not a native Cinema category.
It's good in American content but when it comes to Indian content Netflix lacks in various aspects no proper movies not too many latest movies... I don't find interesting these days. Most loved series by me was Money Heist and Elite so bring up something like this
Cud f gd 3m.eeeeo3.vv
It's the best the best thing on there is the interactive stuff I love it expeshly you vs wild it's so cool! I LOVE IT!...but I dont like it when it glitches and kicks me out and then resets everything again and again so if you could fix this I would love it and thank you.for fixing it if you did. And this is the reason i gave it 3 stars i really really really wanted to make it 5 I'm so sorry
There a movie on all the other accounts but not on mine
Can u please fix the episode's it keeps saying I'm still on episode 16 but really I'm already in episode 24 can u please fix this but I know care but atleast try acknowledge this
Netflex is usually good. But lately everytime we watch it just keeps loading and then shuts down. Very frustrated.
I download on new phone. I cannot open it at all. Not sure why. I had this app on my previous phone. I'm not sure what to do to change the service here from old phone
I like this app but When I watched flash and supergirl it there isn't season 7 flash and season 5 supergirl. my Region is in Indonesia
Good
"Good shows but alot of them are missing dubs/subs and or dont have all the sesons, also due to Disney+ disney movies like mulan keep getting removed wich sucks."
It's a good entertainment app with a great library of both TV shows and movies as well as some great exclusives. I wish they had an expiring list like Hulu does. My biggest is its My List. My settings are set to manual and when I try to change my order it just goes back to how it's currently listed. No matter what I do it won't change to the order I want. I've never had this issue with any of the other streaming services I use.
"Now when I choose the Original language the option to turn off the subtitles disappears, what if I don't want text when I'm watching a movie?"
"I would like to a option simillar to youtube where you can chose your video quality while watching the videos. Because the auto select quality often puts me at a lower quality. It doesn't detect correctly often. So, a option video quality settings would be great."
I love netflix but the thing is it never works when someone else is on the same thing and that doesn't happen with disney plus. This needs to be fixed. That is why i gave it a 3 star reviewe.
To date I have enjoyed my use of Netflix
Depending upon yr tastes!
Good just need more content and more seasons available on the Indian one faster.
Hello netflix. I took 199rs mobile subscription 10 days back. Yesterday i had to sign out of netflix in all device due to security reason. Today as i logged in it says i need to pay again. Look into it.
Honor 10 needs reboot to get image sometimes.. works now though
While watching a show it will cut off in a few minutes and I have to push the resume button but it will keep doing it. My WiFi is strong.
Most of the series or movies I want to watch are unavailable in my country.
"I have been facing a problem for quite a while now.Actually i keep installing and unistalling the app.So a few days back I uninstalled it and then again when i installed it was not working.I put the email address and the password correctly but it says wrong paasword everytime i put it.I cleared my data,tried to sign in through broswer and so on still It's not working I hope this problem will be solved soon â˜¹â˜¹â˜¹it's a great app though!!"
It has a tendency of removing all the shows on my continue watching list for days in a row
Found it fantastic.
Good
Needs more anime
Nice
After latest update it doesnt keep track of last episode i was
Wish the price decrease..
Can't pay via top up?
Everything is not available on netflix.this is worst part of this app
Love the app but it would be help ful if it was easier to differentiate from the videos I have watched and those I haven't
You should let the downloads for viewing offline last longer. We PAYED a LOT of MONEY right? Yo. Your service is so expensive
"No new movies, not even movies of 2018"
Fix the app and you will get 5 stars. Have problems when i watch the movies/series and minimise the app. After returning back to continue with movie says that is unable to continue. Same with stream and downloaded content. Have to reset the app every time.
Slow
Good
I THINK THIS APP IS GOOD.
"Not seen all gujrati and hindi picture guice, do not waste of your money."
"à§«à¦š<à¦¤'*""'' à¦¶à¦—à§«à¦¡à¦¹"
Why it dont have the movie if an anime I know there is a movie in the anime i watched and it only have 3 season instead of 4 seasons
"There is no way to reorder the list. To make it worse, the list seems to be randomly sorted?!"
Keep getting problem in downloading. I have update it many times but still it stops at 23%
I can't play certain movies... Bb it gives me some bs not not being in the right country. Uuuummm I live n Texas... And i should've been able to watch it. One of the movies is pain and gain with mark wahlberg.... I used to love Netflix but this messed it up for me.
New Hollywood as well Indian movies are not available
This app is cool but for some reason a download expires the very same time when finished downloading. Very annoying and a waste of data
Still ðŸ˜§orâ˜º
Good
Some good movies... for only 3-10% of people being homosexual... 98% of the movies are full of it.
y'll removing best shows
We need new movies !!!come on.... there's to many old moviesðŸ‘ŽWe should pick our own movies that's the service i wantðŸ‘
Am no now lowering my ratings. I hate how the lighting is controlled in the app. And when I am watching a series it does start from where I left off. Disappointing.
Poor algorithm to suggest movies... many rows same options
Excellent movie selection but too many are R-RATED!!!!!
It dims the screen quite dark and I can't brighten it???
Neend more good content
Too laggy but Good tho
Netflix Is so dark when you turn hdr on for S20 even with the brightness turned all the way up they need to fix this ASAP
Great if you want to watch through the app alone. If you cast it onto an xbox or a smart TV then it becomes buggie.
"keeps saying errors when using the app. wasnt like this before the last update. using a galaxy a10e an like i said, didnt do this before the last update. can you help fix this?"
What is the logic behind not having the Rating/Review system for the movies??
"Today when i wanted to watch a film which I had already downloaded before it could not be played error was 2.119 i called help centre they told me it wil take time how much time not decided as it is a technical problem, my question is that if it takes 4 days, who wil be responsible ull wil stop my viewing on the day my subscription ends, but the 4 days which i was not able to watch the programs who wil compensates"
"Tend to stuck my phone and I need to use manufacturing restart in order to solve it, but when it works its fine"
"I think netflix is such a great app it's useful on road trips vacations and to distract the grandchildren ðŸ¤£ . But it had such great shows with great reviews and yet got rid of them,so now I have to use my normal television which makes it so much harder ."
Add some more good titles... instead of those lame ones
I can't Search the movies that I want
I am using Samsung J8 and after last update i unable to use this application it's too irritating for me. I have also made payment but not able to use. Plz fix this issue.
"I love netflix but it updated and now I cant open it or sign inðŸ˜­ I even tried deleting and re-installing it, but it won't workðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ please fix it, I really love netflix and I'm in the middle of so many series!!!"
"Content on Netflix is undoubtedly great. But the since Late August the app is not responding well. It's having so much of glitches and errors, it has spoiled the smooth viewing experience as earlier. I checked all the network connection, memory and caches but nothing helps even checked for all the app updates. Kindly rectify."
"Stop removing dubbed version of shows from some specific regions, annoying af."
Abhi pta nhi
"The last update just devastated the smooth Netflix experience, the player is buggy, with the picture stuck and audio running on using forward or backward. The main screen content doesn't update and plays the video from the last seen position. Hope you fix these issues and perform thorough user tests before releasing."
"I used to love this but then when I renew my subscription and updated the apps, it cannot be opened anymore. Had to use the web instead. Really really frustrating. Hope the team fix this."
Good
"This app is really helpful especially when you really want to watch movie all day long. This is also my happiness because i can get to watch KDramas here. But then, I can't open the app because of the error thingy. I have stable connection, internet, wifi, i have enough storage, i did everything i can to open this app but it won't let me in."
Change price to much. Someone else gets same thing and it is cheaper.
"Overall its good, but keeps stoping in between and display comes device failure occured please try again (500.-117) should we pay for this interruptions"
I don't know but what happened to all the animes
Please provide option to stream audio in uncompressed dts hd master audio or Dolby Atmos original track which might not require huge network bandwidth
App is good but they give not latest movie their movies collection. Update new movies all industries.
"No longer allowing casting? Not sure what happened with an update, or what's changed with my device, but I can no longer cast to my Chromecast or Roku devices"
"I enjoy Netflix but there are things I would like you guys to pay attention to, I believe Netflix must add some mainstream *anime shows* like *Naruto Shippuden and Boruto and their movies*, this will give Netflix a totally new feel as we will be able to stream anime legally and conveniently. I hope you see this."
Good
"Good app but some movies,anime and series are not avaliable in my region thats why 4 stars"
I think there is some issues in netflix i can't login my netflix id please fix it
This is just a big nope for me.All the new movies ain't even out on Netflix.This just frustrates me.Anyway apart from that it is decent.Although on my home screen.There is literally no movies!!So I recommend use another app unless you are in USA!So if your in the UK I recommend you not to use this app for movies.
Mas o menos
This app is useless after the last update! It doesn't show where you left series..
"I keep having problems that makes the video lag really bad but the audio runs great. It's very disappointing because I love Netflix, but I keep having this problem on my phone. Back to YouTube I guess."
Please bring back voltron profile pics my dad deleted my profile as a prank and now i cant get back my pidge picture and now I'm mad though this is a good app it upsets me so much that they removed voltron profile pics
Good
"I want to know what Netflix has to offer in terms of its collection, but I have to sign up first before I can do that. I don't need 30 days free trial, I just need relevant information to assist my decision making. That is lacking in Netflix."
Can make netflix for free?so all of us can use this app
Can you remove sporit riding freeðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ 
Took my money 3 times
"great app, great shows! thing is, i've been watching food wars, im on episode 8. but everytime i open it on the netflix app, it starts back from episode one, or goes back a few episodes, and if it does stay on the same episode i was on when i closed the app, it goes back 10 minutes. its confusing and i end up watching several episodes realizing ive already watched them. please fix this."
Bestuejtrt
Its pretty good but I would suggest more shows more often
It won't let me into the app and I had to restart my phone but is still won't work. So mind working on that
I gave this a three star because when I click an account I may on it loads but then kicks me off that's why I gave it three stars you need to fix that and but back on monster house and cora.ime you keep kissing booth that is so stupid but take off the most creative art away put them back pls
i really love this app and EVENTUALLY the movie you like or want to watch will be on it but it usually takes a year or two. you also need a subscribtion to use this app at all. i feel like the veiwers should get a vote on what movies should be taken down because there are a lot of good ones that many people likes that ar no longer on the app. and again you cant use thi app at all without a subscription. there is a free trial though
Why is it so dark on my phone?? Please uodate to allow maximum brightness
Mm its good but now u have to pay alot a month tho and its to buggy
Nothing new coming atleast work on the content and make a bucket like five star six start serials lile this
I want hunter x hunter season 5 and up because you guys left it off at such a big cliff hanger and I wanna know what happened so please put it in I dont wanna wait until march or February of next year
The contents are not always satisfactory and now with the duo Meghan and Harry I am considering unsubscribe
i love it but im signing up but account was need to pay to continue i dunno whats the pin or code
"I like netflix really much... But today i wanted to start ""my hero academia"" and then i saw, that this anime doesn't exist anymore.. And that made me sad... Now i don't know, where i can watch this anime.. After that, i read in the internet, that attack on titan and deathnote will be available till 30th of september... Now i have to watch both animes and also have to hurry... It's kinda sad but okay"
"I appreciate the content, however I like to measure applications by use. I currently have galaxy s20 ultra and even though I'm playing downloaded content it still pauses looking for internet access."
NiceðŸ˜ƒ but you have to set video quality optionðŸ™
I rated 3 stars because I dont have the permition to see every movie like why US will always has more movies than europe even eurupe is bigger and with most population.
Won't open on my phone at the moment.
needs to have family guy and american dad and it needs to have more horror
More than I want. Have it on my kindle and notebook OMG ENOUGH AL READY.
The video is randomly pausing inspite of having good internet. Is it a bug??
Not good
it some times don't work
"Hey Netflix app developers, unlike other apps can't you guys just simply show the popup to update the App when new version is available! Why it shows the message ""can't reach the Netflix try later"". This is stupid."
Is it that difficult to integrate gesture controls???????
5.10 error keeps showing up fir me
. Mm
Good App please also provide language info in detail
Its lagging
The app keeps crashing and needs to be reinstalled multiple times.
"I likeit but we dont need a few of the shows on there you know what i want,i want coraline whyd you take it of thats the only reason i wanted it mostly"
"It would have been much better if we had the below features in the app. 1. There should be simple sort option in the app. Sort by Year, Name and so on.. If we select Hindi and if there is sort by year option then it would have been very much simpler for me to search movies. 2. Simple Filter options like, Filter by actor, actress, director and so on."
I don't know Netflix mistake I have to cancel my whole Netflix membership and then wait a whole three days to get my money back before I can reinstate my membership and it's Netflix fault. I don't understand stand that's why I should have been given Hulu my money
Dislike automated app Brightness. I just want it to be the the bright tone i have it set to be before i go into the app
You dont have the latest films and series..lots of us like young sheldon
Pls i need bangla language in audio subtile there... Kindly add this... ðŸ˜
Don't know why but it's not taking 199 plan after 4months now it's directly taking 649 plan without even giving options
"Just so many chav films, too much reality rubbish. Not enough older films, in fact, not enough film genre choice at all. Some subscribers were born before 1999, it would be nice if films reflected this. Also, on the screen it looks like there are 100s of different films, yet n reality there's just so much cross over in the separate genres. Some of us like old black and white films, old old comedy, not the rubbish shown today."
Very good app for movies and tv programs
"The only problem os that we cannot rotate it. Besides these , great appðŸ˜Š"
Not updated with latest movies.
Well
Love it....this app very good and nice more movies..
Nice
Good aps

Maaai
"Hi netlfix ,can you please check with my account? because i can't play any movie with error 2.0 ."
It's a wonderful app but most of movies that I search for I can't find on Netflix !!
"Why i cant open the app, it said that it can't find the server"
No debit card or upi payment option
"it's great but there's a problem with download using wifi, my connection is like 10mbps but the app can't seem to reach 500kbps speed when downloading using wifi"
"Just a question? ""why Naruto shippuden or other Naruto movies in Netflix since we paying to watch what we want not what you want."""
Not enough new movies. used to netflix was the bomb.not so much anymore
Deleted all of my history of almost 2 years from one of my profiles after about 6 months of not going into that one....
Love This App So Much But Theres One Thing And It's The Fact That Movies And New Season Come To Jamaica Late.
"I am rating it 3 star, i will give it 5 stars if you solve it, all things are good, just one problem i.e subtitles position, please give options for subtitles so that we can drag them bottom of the screen, the subtitles clearly comes in front of characters, its really annoying and spoil all the fun, please do it, and also please add HOMELAND web series,"
Netflix is ok I guessðŸ˜‰
Need more exciting movies and popular anima like one piece
"I've been a Netflix user and i love it! Unfortunately, lately whenever i watch it crashes in the middle of the movie. It keeps crashing over and over again. Please do fix it. Thank you"
Plenty of good shows are being removed and not many good ones are being added. Considering the prices are always increasing i would hope that they add better shows but they are not. I might just delete my account and find a better application.
"Cant change resolution, i tried from chrome, but still didnt effect the app"
Need newer movies
I liked Netflix more when I could rate a show instead of just giving a thumbs up or down. My opinions have more dimension than just good or bad.
How do I go in I can't pay I'm only 13
3 starts bc my little pony has 9 seasons and Netflix only shows 5 ðŸ˜”
"Never the movie I want to watch, always settled for something else."
M.nadeem 1947
Please add more episode of bleach animation series
Ok
Good but costly
Gud
"It's ok I guess. There are a lot of shows to choose from but some of the shows don't have the latest seasons, especially on Pakistani netflix. And if there is it gets removed after some time. It would be great if Netflix Inc. started updating their library more often."
"The app is very bad at remembering which episode I am currently on. If, while watching I get a call and then come back to the app it starts playing the episode from the beginning. Sometimes when I relaunch the app it shows an older episode in the continue watching section."
I can't take screenshots from Netflix.
Good
Previously it was good but now I'm facing trouble while watching downloaded episodes.. always they are showing error..
Good
Good
I love the app. But ever since the update I got 2 days ago I'll be in the middle of watching something and the picture will freeze but still have the sound. Ive6never had a problem until now. Not very happy with it.
"This app is good and easy to use, I really like it"
Good streaming app but content is very less!!!
"I have updated this app several times, but this has started new, it doesn't resume from where I have left off in the ""Continue watching"" section. It didn't happened previously, but is is happening now. I have the latest version of app but still the issue persists."
Very Costly
The app is good but I don't know since the recent update I'm not able to renew my monthly subscription.
Make subscription fee purchasable via Google Wallet please. My Debit Card cannot be used for online transaction.
Unknown
Some series are not available on my country.
Netflix would be better if they added part 5 to jojo's bizarre adventure ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ ADD PART 5 ADD JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE GOLDEN WIND PLS NETFLIX PLSSS
No full screen support on Pixel 4a. There's a black at where the notification bar used to be. The whole screen shifts towards the chin of the phone.
ðŸ’¯
"Not enough New movies, or tv shows. Trying to be to political."
"I really like this app but the thing is that most of the shows I like to watch doesnt include all the seasons. And for me to be able to watch all the seasons I'd have to download another app to watch the whole show, and that it would be easier for Netflix to include ALL seasons."
Is great
"Netflix keeps stopping and it gives me the option to report it, which I do... but nothings changing! This happens daily ðŸ˜ . Also its making me log out of netflix and back in every single day. This is very frutrating considering we pay for this.... I can see having these issues from a free app! Netfix, we need you to do better! These are new issues cause I wasnt having these problems before and its not due to my internet connection because I have a strong signal!"
Takes forever to load
"Hey netflix, please add other payment method"
Good
Good content.
Add more payment options
BBC
"It's solid but recently it's been acting up by not saving progress and returning to the middle of previous episodes but apart from that streaming is solid, the occasional blip every now and again but I guess that's to be expected."
Its good ..i don't have boring times now cuz ive got movies to watch according to my emotions ðŸ˜‚
I wish u can use the Netflix app on android as a remote on the TV. it's hard to navigate on the tv when it doesn't show the whole episodes.
Sloow af now
"The app works well for the most part, but this last update has caused some issues. My picture in picture has stopped working, and if I close the app while in the middle of an episode, when I start it up again it takes me back three or four episodes."
I can't search the past movies that I've watched already.
I just wanted to know do Netflix have all movies right?
ITS GETTING ANNOYING NOW. IT DOESNT SAVE THE LAST EP I WATCHED. ITS TIRING
It never gets new stuff i like
Nice but kinda loading. If you watch movie..
"It,s the best"
Id give it 5 stars if it didn't cost as much as it does.
Needs more clean movies and shows
Ok
Too expensive
Very good app
Please make all series and movies available in all languages. Atleast my language Telugu. That's all. Otherwise NETFLIX is great
I like this
"Why my debit card isn't accept for payment...Netflix should add some more payment options like UPI,or other online payment"
Nice but no spongebob
They should fix the continued watching! When a show is done it does not go to the next show anymore.
Sexy
Cool but we need to watch in HD
I doesn't let me download anything. And I have to keep logging in again it's annoying
There are glitches in the video ...some disturbance during playing videos
"Netflix is great. however its been struggling to play anything. got connection, all other internet stuff works, just not Netflix , even a 16mb update takes about 20 minutes"
One it made me lose my profile and said my account was invalid
"Since almost few days, netflix is giving a lot of errors on android app. Like the screen just closes saying some error although i have good internet and wifi connection. It gets connected on xbox but not on phone. Now that i have to complete the payment for the month and its not even accepting the card. Not even on google browser. You really gotta fix this issue"
The subtitles keeps vanishing in the mobile app..evry time the app is launched..pls address this asap
To many movie do not have in netflix
All shows are not available
"It works well and then out of nowhere it will ask for the password again and I'll put it in But it will tell me it's wrong every time , it annoys me very much..."
Confusing to set up on fire stick
Fun at first then just soul sucking drama the longer you watch. I miss movie theatres ðŸ¿
Ok
can not login after this update
Eve since last update Netflix is not saving where i am up to in a series. Makes it hard to find having to go through episodes to see where i left off
Good
"Mostly old movies inside, kinda getting bored of netflix"
Its an amazing app but please put all episodes in it it's not all complete anime episodes I'm just pissed but it's a amazing app tho great job!
Swe
"COULD do with new movie's. Old ones stay too long, more animal stories PLEASE. And Xmas movie's,and love stories"

Something wrong when i fast forward the movie it stuck
I can't install this app in other phone and please make sure to fix this problem as soon as possible
I can't login to my laptop I am login on my phone though but I've already reset the password and it went successfully but every time i try to log in on my laptop it says something went wrong please try again later it doesn't said that I've used an incorrect password just something went wrong
It is a great app
"Collection is not good enough, there are many series of movies which are not part of Netflix India. Also I am unable to play content in full screen even after choosing good plan."
It consumes more data in a hour
Plss put more series of hindi also in Netflix and if possible low the price . Allover it's nice app
"Has good quality shows and movies, however its extremly frustrating when I start to watcha show that has four seasons but this sight has only released one or two of them."
"Great selection, does not pick up where u leave off. It returns to episodes that u have already watched. Select an episode you were watching, it starts it from the top again. It's a mess."
"Netflix is good if your okay with having to wait a year or two for it update its shows. Also the verity of t.v shows is mild. I want more shows like ""My hero academia"" and ""Bungo stray dogs"" wich you have to pirate to get. If it added stuff like that, I know people will be using this app more."
"I wish there were more english movies and less dubbing or voice overs, it limits the entertainment, like really, who can watch that?"
need more anime
its good but im still looking forward for those block buster movies to be available soon
I can't even get it to play the picture it's just audio and when it shows the picture it freezes but the audio still keeps going
"Love the app on the phone. Although when traveling abroad, I couldn't watch the movies I downloaded in the states. Also, when I try to log in on a smart tv it always says my info is incorrect. Tried 3 different TV's and nothing! Now i have 2 accounts i am being charged for. H"
Really wish i could filter out all non english speaking content.....
It made me sign in over and over
Keeps force crashing would give it zero stars if i could.
Good.
Great
The lightning is automatically dimmed lower on my phone(Samsung A70)while watching. I try manually to lower it but it says lighting controlled by the app?? This is totally new
Need more anime
I wish there was a way to turn off the brightness slider. I'd rather just use the brightness settings on my phone. Everything else is fine.
It's 50 50 they need to put an option to pay yearly or as many months ahead as you want this whole having to buy gift cards just to get a few months ahead not being able to pay your payments before the date is ridiculous also when you trying to find a movie on there whatever movie that you say you want to watch it throws you at anything else besides that movie I have never found the movie that I want to watch on Netflix by typing it in the search bar so there are improvements they can make
"I really don't like that they dont put in every episode in, for example in One Peice, they only have like 150 episodes of it, when there's actually almost 800, and it's kinda annoying cuz it's like that with alot of other shows too"
This app is good but staring so slack on getting up new things to watch the videos keep stopping and starting not eve 5min in the a movie or episode and it's not r wifi which I thought it was but it's something to do with the app can u please fix it!!
"Currently, I'm trying out Netflix on trial basis... I dont like a lot of subscript movies... But, I will say U do have a lot of grt, trending new movies other than those type... Maybe I will check back in later with U Netflix... Sorry"
I like Netflix but I dont like you need to payðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ˜‘ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¡
Picture-in-picture feature stop working
"The app itself is pretty solid, except for a couple minor things like sometimes when i watch my downloads it will take me back to previous chapters, everything is nice. My issue, and the readon this review is only 3 stars is the catalogue. In my opinion, Netflix could be one of the better anime steaming sites if they just added more anime and invested in making good Netflix Original animes AND PUT ALL THE SEASONS. No one wants a new Kissing Booth movie, or ANOTHER 13RW season. Add color themes!"
Movies..ok
Good app
Awesome
You can't find any movie you want.
THEY TOOK OFF KARATE KID RIGHT WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO WATCH THEM THIS MORNING. VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEY NEED TO BRING IN OLDER MOVIES INSTEAD OF THESE STUPID ROM-COMS THAT ARE NOT FUNNY. YOU GUYS NEED TO CHANGE AND BRING BACK OUR FAVORITES. I AM VERY SAD NOW AND GOODBYE. HAHA SIKE. I NEED KARATE KID BACK PLEASE!! I'M PAYING FOR ALL MY FAVORITE MOVIES AND I EXPECT THEM TO STILL BE THERE WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.
Not enough movies and old programmes
"This app is great, but this recent update has been extremely frustrating! It will take FOREVERR to load and I have good connection. Then when it loads it will play a few seconds and then stop and not continue or it will freeze making me have to go out and repeat the grueling process all over again! I have tried uninstalling it, clearing it, everything I can think of and it's not working! Please help! :("
Can you give free subscription to meðŸ˜€
They are not giving the offers such as they give in USA
sometimes the screen just looks really bad and this is a good working chrome book
Every video is showing a green patchy interrupted screen and the interface lags too much. It seems like I'm rendering the Video and playing it simultaneously. Seriously fix it up!
I hate how it only has some of the seasons for animes it's annoying since I cant finish them and netflix should add more anime.
No new movies
Wow
Someting wrong dont want to lock in after update sumtime it lock in most of the time it wont lock in
Good experience
It's an okay app needs improvement but still okay
Great app but it only allowed a little bit of people to get in so thats not good.
Some good stuff but lots of junk
"Very nice app,, I just think that it should have quite a few more shows."
"I use the app everyday and I love it! However, I lately it has been really difficult to watch shows because it doesn't continue on to the next episode or season. Instead, it goes backwards or to a different season than I am already on."
This app is the best app to watch sth I like but unfortunately there was some obstacle in payment. Idk what happened but it isn't working
They keep taking down the movies I like to watch
Grayt content but the start of a epesod is a little fuzzy
Love it
Film search needs improvement
"So I rate this and I'm finding 'Saving Hope' I really want to watch so WHERE IS IT I WANNA WATCH, NETFLIX PLS DONT REMOVE THE OLD MOVIESS"
Netflix is honestly such a nice app to use the Quality of the movies is amazing. However it consist mostly old movies that we already know and can get it elsewhere for free
Good
Not clear
Good
"Dear Netflix, why is my app not working in my Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro phone? ðŸ¥º"
"Nothing is like Netflix! Since the last update, whenever I'm receiving a call while watching something, there is no sound after the call! I have to restart my device in order to receive the call."
Super
I like this app but instead of adding the whole season in a go very late can you plz add 1 episode of that show every time the new episode releases
"everyday, I have to delete the app and then install it again!"
The app keeps on having issues every couple of days for which i need to force stop the app to work it smoothly
I am having issues while casting Netflix on tv It shows black screen on tv
Giving only 3 stars due to the limited content of Indian TV series and movies.
Since the update have been getting major glitches and sorry couldn't load this .... It's annoying
I love movie but you have fun
Sir india ke liye Paytm ka support and Rup Card add kar la jyada logon ke pass MasterCard nahin hota Please sir try now and butter result Love you Netflix streaming online
"App asked for phone number while not necessary for service. Netflix support chat could not clearly explain why needed. Suggestions ranged from 'needed for credit card' (the card issuer never requires it) to 'account authorization' (while Netflix used username/pwd). Besides, the app continually closes immediately after opening. This happened after renewing membership after cancelling."
"Netflix has a wonderful selection of older classic movie, TV's as best shows and series past and current. Independantes as well as Netflix originals. Comedies, drama, horror/syfi, documentaries. They strive to bring you the best of best as selected by viewers. However they do not bring you many of the newer and older movies that were well reviewed by the viwers. And when and if they do you have pay above your subscription. It really makes it hard to justify paying that monthly."
"Love the app mostly, but recently the play button stopped functioning. For instance if I have to pause a movie or show the 10sec plus or minus buttons still function, but I cannot just hit play to resume where I left off. It's a giant hassle to be honest and I hope you can patch it quickly so it works. Galaxy s8 fyi ....thanks."
"Necesitan poner mejores peliculas, hay muuuuchas pero la mayoria son muy malas, sobre todo las peliculas de terror esas son muy nefastas"
Its a nice app i really enjoy watching #netflix
Would like to be able to see available audio languages BEFORE I start reading a title.
Pls bring download option in TV version too
"Netflix is a very entertaining app but it would make me the happiest girl on the planet if they would put all seasons of My Hero Academia including more popular Animes for weebs like me, and when or if that happens I'll give it a 5-star rating... promise ðŸ¤žâ¤ï¸ðŸ˜Š"
Good

"I have had this app for years. Lately, it wont work. I have to uninstall and reinstall EVERY time I watch. Very annoying. Please fix it."
Good
Seems like the update blew up. Causes Netflix to play back what I was watching but didn't finish but putting me back at the beginning. No. Please don't do that. Fix it please. I think it's a bug that Netflix might have left creeping around.
Good
Why indian netflix sucks man only old movies bored asf pls bring some good entertainment
"Everytime I try to watch this show you just doesn't let me watch the show, I still have Wi-Fi connection."
Doesn't have the movies I want to watch
Wish it had more titles.
Had to disable the auto update. Only through my mobile device I'm able to enjoy Netflix minus the new look.
"Ãšltimamente eh estado utilizando la aplicaciÃ³n y me ha estado dando algunos fallos como que no me reproduce correctamente el episodio o me lo atrasa, por favor solucionen lo."
There are 4 seasons (or 3) of haikyuu. The only season that are in Netflix of haikyuu are 1 and 2. But on my friends it shows all the seasons. Is there some thing I could do to fix it?
"Im confused biut the emails. I keep getting the same email like * we cannot process payment, your account will be on hold* but even if is scam has the logo and everything. As for streaming never had issues and variety of series and movies."

I'd love if u brought back mean girl and everything sucks but its kinda bad that i cant watch many films because they are american. Please bring euphoria to uk netflix
I love Netflix but since the last update a lot of errors would usually pop up and it's very annoying
I love the app. My only complaint is that my Netflix HD is not available on my new Oneplus 8. This is very disappointing.
Good but a
"Good app, however I am getting error saying ""you might be using a proxy"" I have no such proxy, and the series I could watch it before"
"It's an okay app. Teenagers who are hyped about getting this app, there's nothing special about it. It doesn't have a lot of shows."
Another pay to watch 70% of things you don't care about
I am so worried coz I still can't open my old account. I can sign up but when I am in my account will immediately signed out. I don't know why but this happened always. in my account and in my friend's account.
I'm rating it five if y'all remove cuties
"Awesome but in other countries they might not have as much TV shows as the rest of the world some poeople are missing out on some shows ,movies and TV series"
its good but its always say there a problem with playing the video! or i cab hear sound playing in the background but no image
I'm having issues with downloading it automatically stops after download of 1 episode then after 8-10 minutes later start to download another episode
Just okay ðŸ˜Š
IT is very nice b
I cant choose video quality
Pentru Netflix RomÃ¢nia: unele filme au audio NUMAI hindi....ce rost mai are sÄƒ le lÄƒsaÈ›i Ã®n listÄƒ?????
in the middle of watching a series and they removed it the next day
always crush
I like movies more than series and Netflix all about seasons
It's the best streaming app for me but recently I've been experiencing problems evrytime I try to use. I open it and it always says that there's a connection error while my other apps are all functioning well with the internet. It's built in app on my phone so i cant uninstall and install again. I dunno if the problem's my phone or not but I'm having a hard time with it. I'm hoping this gets fixed if the problem's within the app.
Recently I am seeing all the settings in japanese language I am trying settings in english but it becoming diffucult for me as its continuing displaying in japanese content
Kicks me out
Best app for entertainment
Good experience with Netflix
âœŒï¸
Lagy sometimes
Needs more movies to choose from
I love this much u can watch movie but u have to pay so I'm giving it a 3
Best
"They could have more options honestly. It's okay, it's netflix."
"I tried to watch some Netflix today, but it kept closing the app and it wouldn't work. Otherwise, it's a great app! Love it!"
I think it's just me or if this happens to all of us where is my mobile plan but when I try and download Netflix it always puts me to editors choice and won't download especially one in that it all it always says disk cannot be reached and most the time I try and watch my favorite shows and it doesn't give a good info
It keeps turning off and they don't have rick and morty
Please make the background of subtitles transparent as before. It's looks so bad with a black background.
Nice..que mas quieres que te diga?
Old movies nothing newer only action movies staring has-beens
Great.
Good.
There should be a better way to control the content so that stuff you don't like or find offensive can be blocked also if the account is US based content should be in English and if not the language should be on the show description
Kinda gay
"I dont know why I cannot set up my billing. its says sorry something went wrong, please try again later"
"Please add another payment options, not everyone have credit card.."
"I hate when you type in a topic that interests you i. e. True crime documentaries ) it's doesn't give you/ show you all available titles in your particular choosen subject. Regularly buffers or tells me titles aren't currently available as there having trouble playing them. Finding I'm using Amazon Prime more & more frequently these day's, great at showing other programmes that might interest you, &/ or suggest other shows based on what you watch etc. Long overdue a good revamp in my opinion"
Netflix is Ok but I liked the show Lab Rats thats why I mainly stopped using it. Then i switched to Disney+ because they have Lab Rats. They always get rid of the shows / movies I love that is quite annoying.
i would like the rest of the seasons to 'miraculous tales of ladybug' since i have watched all seasons put up for the show and i want more :) thank you.
"I love it, it has alot of cool anime that I like, but one thing I absolutely don't like is that one series,haikyu!!, Has 4 seasons but on Netflix it only has 2 and I don't like that another one is that, it doesn't give an option for ""non bad language"" ofcourse I really don't have a problem but maybe some people don't like that Netflix doesn't have that, tbh I kinda do have a prob withe that but yea. That's it,if it didn't have those problems then I would give it a 5star"
"The app itself is great. The content is awesome. There has been some problems with the downloads for months now. Downloaded content doesn't play and the techs don't seem to know the issue. When contacting support, they have no solution."
Stopped working after 2nd day
Slow downloding
"I enjoy the content of this service, but the app is just too inconsistent. The app randomly decides to record your progress through some episodes/movies, but refuses to do so for others. Switching back over to the app after momentarily checking something in another app sometimes restarts an episode/movie. Sometimes the pop-out video player works, other times the UI just freezes and you can't play the content you were watching. TL;DR: Content is great, user experience is pretty shoddy."
It mysteriously disappeared from my phone and now so difficult to redownload
Great but needs more movies uploaded.
I don't like to logging in with a different user in my account but still unable to access the downloads from the primary account!!
My app videos are stoping in between even the audio is going on.. In good Internet connection.. Plz kindly check or update
How many people watch this stuff
"Affordable,clean,sharp and just really good"
Great movies but not everything i want is there
Good
"Worked for a little while then suddenly started displaying error code -14 on startup and won't let me into the app. I have tried all troubleshooting suggestions, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, logged out and back in, cleared storage and cache but still getting the same error message. Very dissapointed as I would have like to use it for my long-haul flight. ***UPDATE I have been using the app after doing a powerwash on my device due to other issues, the app has been working fine since."
It is very expensive with plans and quality is very poor according to internet. Secondly you did not able to delete or edit your 'My List'.It should easy to use..
"I really really hated the new way the research shows, it's not useful. I liked better when I looked up a actor and did not have to look through every category for movies that might have say actor or not, plus when the movie a look for is not available I still have to search through to be sure. Anyway, it's really messy and discouraging me to see anything at all."
I would like to say the series are awesome but only one problem please the price should be low
This is the perfect movie download And series pls add block z
To much storage
Tutto bene fino a quando dopo l'aggiornamento non mi si apre piÃ¹ l'applicazione
Can't access
Its OK I just dont like that there are missing season. But i like it that it haves lots of animes. If the episodes and season are complete it would be greateðŸ‘Œ
Good
Good
Although it cannot be downloaded on my device
"I downloaded a few series to watch offline on my phone but after watching an episode the next episode won't play, the app would randomly play one episode from the previous ones instead of the next one."
Could have the old rockys on here
I can't play the movies cause need to buy and fill up so this is wasting time!
"Never use the smart download because it downloaded the wrong episode and I deleted it and now I cant download it again, never again I will use smart download!"
They need to update their movie list more often. I feel like they take too long to add new things to watch.
For some reason while on a call on messager instagram or snapchat it cuts it off like I'm just trying to watch Netflix while talking to my gf bruh
Please add more disney films
Cant fast forward videos. Using samsung phone j7
The app is awesome and there are cool things to watch. But I don't like that in the other countries there are many more and good things to watch than where I live. I pay so much money and I can't even whatch what I want.
Unable to cast from mobile to TV using mibox
Nice
On my first trail to download the there was a problem in downloading the app
Not a lot of good series anymore and the good ones are only there for a limited time. Have to wait ages for the next season to come!!
cool
"Nice, just can't afford"
It should be free
Not all movies are available
Whenever i feel bored its lyk wht do i do now.. Bt having a Netflix account is like.. U can always watch ur fav series or movies whatever we like n at anytime.. The only concern of having Netflix is the price
I think it is getting boring honestly. Nothing interesting films and all those series...ugh!*
More old movies please
"Netflix is one of the best platform to watch movies but o gave 3 stars Cuz in Netflix India hardly anything is there,"
"Please add simple option of changing language through app, and other option to change language of videos in media options"
Bring Back Mortal Kombat
"Hey netflix, please add the option to pay for netflix from paytm or google pay. I am a teenager and my parents are afraid to give their credit card number away. Please help, please."
Its okay
The amount of shows and movies are not that good. Main downside is it's cost. Is is way to expensive and the pricing options are such a scam. You pay 400 rupees for mobile plus is ridiculous.
"âš ï¸PLEASE READ THISâš ï¸ It's a good streaming and all but NETFLIX LISTEN ðŸ‘stopðŸ‘ cancelingðŸ‘ goodðŸ‘ showsðŸ‘ WE DONT WANT ANOTHER KISSING BOOTH, it cost us, I'm not okay with this, the society and another show. You stop making episodes for quality and famous shows but when it comes to crappy shows like Riverdale you let them go on for seasons. Stop making episodes for Riverdale and make more for stranger things! Also 13 reasons why. It's not a good show! The first season was but now it's annoying!"
too much costly comparison to other provider specially in india... it cost approx 1500 / year / user that's sufficient.... otherwise people use alternate methods ðŸ˜ƒ
"When I got my note 20, while watching with my wife on the phone, whenever I pause Netflix it refuses to play again unless I exit the app and select my show again. This has never happened before."
No idea yet
its a pritty good app
nmx
"Netflix on your phone does not work properly, it is really frustrating as the play button does not work after you pause it."
Netflix keeps on closing when I click my account to sign in
Can you let us connect our downloads from phone to laptop? It was just such a waste of data not being able to watch it on a larger screen
I like it some what. But I am trying to watch supergirl but for some reason it plays a lil bit at a time and then it freezes on me so far it's the only show that is doing it to me and I really like that show I am on season 2. But for some reason it won't play on my phone.
"I found Netflix good for a few months, then all the same old content. It would be more inviting to take half of all the 1990s content and upgrade newer recent movies and TV series."
It is omkay

Its an awsome app! Wish it had more manga series though. Otherwise great for entertainment! And a great family movie night.
Lack of quality content in India
FYI I have had no problems I wish ever so often you give us 3 months promotional discount I I've bee a long time user in an just like you but there's is weekly yours is yearly I was getting charged 8.99 now I pay 5.99
Good app nice tv movies but god enough with the 8 million emails ye send
Can i get a free netflix account pls
I'm experiencing problem in video streaming I can't able to see the visual it showing lots of pixels
I keep getting these errors ... 1023....not the case with amazon prime or disney hotstar...
Every time I use this app I have to update it and I don't know why
Just needs vetter options for me but pretty good
I like it but they took all my fav shows off
"Always having problem to watch it, due to error but don't know what is the error"
"Hi! I would like to report something important. We have an account in netflix, this happened a while ago, we received a notification that we have a bill of Php 549 for Ultra Hd premium account, we are currently subscribed for Php 149 standard account (lowest payment), then we check our netflix account, we only have 2 user, (me and my husband) for at least 3 devices. But then we saw a unauthorized name (which is not in our language), he is using our account but we dont know him , his in the list."
"It's good, but theres not alot of new stuff on here to watch, always end up watch something that looks like it was made in a basement"
With the update of 7 aril I m not able to open this app immdetely it take so long There is no doubt dis update is ðŸ‘Ž
Really good app but I'm kind of disappointed cuz it is not really updated to animes like my hero academia season 4 was released in 2019 and it's already 2020 still season 4 is not available there and some episodes are always missing so fix it soon and also keep updating because it lacks updates.
Watching
Wish it was cheaper and had better shows
The best for streaming although I wish there was some more things in South Africa like there is in places like America
why there's no star wars films and other old films please add it back... tq
Good app just please make the library open to every one because there are things i cant watch because of my location and thats stupid
Add more movies and series
Alittle slow at times
Why is there not an option to see what I've already watched can the developers think about it. Can you stop messing with my list
It's.... Ok I guess....
"Horrible search function and really annoying that they constantly update the database, even getting rid of movies you add to your favourites list. Needs to be more intuitive. Would not recommend"
Too much drug movies
It's really good but I'm not giving it 5 stars because it doesn't let me watch series and movies in Spanish from Spain. It only let's me watch stuff in English or Spanish for Latin American. If you can fix this I would give you 5 stars
"Would read more if there was a way to mark a season / episode as watched.. sometimes there are Rogue unwatched items in something I have watched!.. and they seem to linger around in my unwatched list forever!.. and the ""new episodes"" should be an overlay, that either disappears after a time OR after you watch them.. otherwise it states ""New episodes"" when you have seen them all!"
And u
Good shows
"I was watching an anime last night, but today it gone. Even my list is empty and only got the new anime i put on the list. Care to explain why? It's kinda resetting my Netflix. This is really bad."
"As far as movies and boxsets, your half way there"
They took down the Volton icons. They should add Avatar icons
"I'm stuck on the black and red 'Netflix' screen, a lengthy amount of time has passed, software issue?"
Gj
UUM i only use its when im big sorry:(
Itself nice but NOT enjoying it in OnePlus Nord as it cannot be viewed in fullscreen.
I am having trouble logging in the app when I know my password is correct
This new player is horrible
Fwd or rewind. Logs me out. Update: issue resolved...
Good
It's an awesome app me and my family enjoy it but there is one issue when when I try watching a show this thing pops up and it's confusing. To be honest I'm getting angry with this app.
I use Netflix quite often but what upsets me is how they never complete some series. For example I was watching HXH and it ended at season 4 leaving a huge cliff hanger :( it also feels like they delete some of the bests series and movies
It keeps crashing.
I would have given it a 5 but i would like one consideration that i should be able to change my plan even if my account is on hold.. So that i can recharge as per my wish...
"I don't know know why there isn't any option to check the logged in devices, like the prime. Isn't that a basic thing to keep a track on our account. I don't know why the netflix is leaving these simple things that make the main user comfortable like de-registering the devices from the main acoount, like the prime. The shows and content are great but the UI is worst (Needs a lot more improvement). If u thought someone got access to ur account, you hav to sign out of all devices. can't continue"
I like netflix
It would have been five but the price is getting too steep for me to keep it but otherwise a good app to have
Seems to not work at times then have to uninstall then reinstall
Does not track watched series anymore. Perhaps because watching via Chromecast.
It's fine but season's of some of the shows that I watch are not there please can you explain to me why there are missing?
"Netflix always wants me to update. Error says ""woud not reach Neflix service."" I DONT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO. IM A BIG FAN OF NETFLIX BUT I KEEP GETTING ERRORS, I JUST DONT KNOW URGH."
The netfilx are not workðŸ˜¡.why but Okay the app are goodðŸ™‚ .this reason I give 5/3.but I recommend but the appðŸ˜are not very niceðŸ˜¯
Yes juice and ydey to it
"Hey in this update, the last viewed is not working properly.. I was in S2E10 but it's showing as S1E21. And if I continue watching an episode, the starts from the first instead of resuming.. Please resolve that"
cool
"App nya suka eror ihhh kemarin gak bisa play video, sekarang malah gak bisa masuk"
It is not working in LG smart tv
"I don't know if your computer is the problem or what. I'm pretty sure I only pay $9.99 since I choose basic, but I got charge for $10.99. I hope you resolve this problem. I don't have that much money since it's quarantine. I'm having netflix because my fam wants to watch something."
Di
You should have mobile money too as an option to pay for the subscription...Me like this I only have mobile money
Its a good app to watch movies but sometimes when i was watching the screen just became static and when i pause the movie the static is still theere but just paused and i know this is a netflix problem because a long time ago when i rewatch a movie or series IT DID NOT HAPPEND SO NETFLIX FIX YOUR PROBLEM IVE BEEN SKIPING EPISODES OF MANY SERIES SO FIX THE PROBLEM IM TIRED OF THIS!!!!!!!!
I am no longer able to watch movies since I upgraded to the standard package. I am very disappointed in this fact.
If gangsters movie at wat I watch
"Can the search result be just ""no related movie found"" if there isn't any movie related being typed on the search box. and please add some playing options on the app settings. thanks!"
"There's some things that can improve: - Payment term, it will be nice if available for prepaid option - Payment method, with prepaid option available so payment method such like bank transfer, pay from marketplace or any other local payment processor will be great to added. - Subtitle, many movies not yet have Indonesia subtitle, at least it should have option to hide movies that doesnt have subtitle from language that we choosen - Netflix cerrified that not supported on some devices"
App is very upgraded and covenient to use.All genres are well categorised.There are so many options to connect with any device. But the major issue is that new videos are not available.Old incomplete seasons are still incomplete.New seasons are not available.It is getting boring now.
I want to give him 5stars but Hi stop while watching like=I will watch 2or3 films after he will stoping he work slowly I checked the Wifi if he work slowly put not he work faster and YouTube Facebook any other things then try again Netflix to watch still not working please fix that I love Netflix But this is the problem to fix it so want to get fix it And I will give 5starsâ­â­â­â­â­and share it to my family and friends so I hope to fix this problem
buggy on desktop/pc
What is error code -1023?
"It s good but,when im watching it always keep signing out"
Needs a few more movie's but it's still great
Sometimes drops out with Gobbledygook reasons
Sometimes not worth it
I enjoyed watching movies and TV shows on this app.
Not enough movies options.
Need more movies that are not picked by soy beta cucks and man bashing feminists please
"How can i sign in i forgot what account i loged before,my acoount keep on renewing sending me i renew it but i haven't watched in netflix i even uninstall the app..please hepl me what im going to do"
I don't really watch Netflix while say it's a good movie that has really good
Love netflix
Please put more movies especially the trending movies.
Are you continue watching Ugh remove that i was in the middle of watching stranger things then that popped up and something amazing was happening and add all seasons of all shows not just Netflix original cuz we need to watch all full seasons please and it will just switch off most the time but other than that we are good it has good movies sometimes good quality adds new popular shows so its good
I had Netflix for a while but now none of the pictures will load I've installed and reinstalled but nothing is working
Great App
Good
I  love movies and I have used Netflix before
Not too good But its Manageable
It is good. If have only obe Subtaitle. If add more language Subtaitle it is more good
This would have gotten 5 a five stars but i cant get the show i want to watch that you can get in other countries
"Netflix is a great service whether it goes for mac windows or ps4, but damn how hard can it be to fix a few glitches on android. Sometimes I'll be half way through a show and when I use the short cut panel (continue to watch) it goes back to a random episode and it's just annoying to find where I left off."
Nice
I've had netflix for more then a year and theres one thing in particular I'm very unhappy with. A box pops up about every 20 minutes asking me if I'm still watching. Its especially annoying when I turn an educational cartoon on for my just-now-turned-three year old grandson + try to catch a short nap. Impossible. I need the sound of my tv playing to sleep and I'm woke up several times a night because netflix wants to know if I'm still watching. As soon as I can get a smart tv I'm afraid netflix
"Recently I am facing a playback error in the app. Whenever I resume watching the video, nothing comes up on the screen even though the audio and the subtitles keep on playing. I updated the app but still the problem persists."
App has been sluggish in recent months. Requires logging into my profile even though I have only one profile. Generally rather lazy design given the size of the user Base.
Need more newer movies and TV series. Should I for discounts and promotions for people who use this app and site on a regular basis. Would like to have surveys done on what type of content you watch often to add those options to your list more often in on the site
Love itâ¤
Playful kiss season 1-3 please ðŸ˜”

"After the latest update of mobile android mobile app, I am not able to start any thing where I left off.. It is showing some old episode... Not getting update properly.."
Its so good... please upload naruto all season...
After the last update Chromecast has stopped working.
I think you should make the Netflix for free for 8 to 10 months so it will become the daily life of the people and during free Netflix you can ads as many you want due this you will not in loss also after 8 to 10 months you can start with cheapest price and start increasing price after every 3 month
I love this app but the reason why I'm giving it three stars is because five out of seven days in the week you can't watch anything because on the screen pops up an error has occurred. And it stays like that for the rest of the day. So until it gets fixed I'm not watching Netflix. And in my opinion they need to have more horror movies
I was using Netflix since long on my brother's account...however have taken for myself but some recent updates has taken away the ability to minimise the playing window while navigating through another apps simultaneously. Hence given 3 star. Bring that up pls.
Plizz add more chinese action movies
"i signed out all devices then update it, now I can't find some series I want to watch. what do I do."
It a great app but u guys should remove the expiring date of the downloaded series
The sound is not good my volume reach to 100 but still ðŸŒ slow..
Good
"This app is great but my problem is that alot of the anime here is incomplete (like Jojo, sao and mha) and sometimes the app just stops working"

Unable to open netflix. Why have I paid this much amount when I am unable to even use it.
They Deleted my favorite shows just add some new ones but it is still good Why it says Upgrade to 4 screens but What is says I have to get Off of my phone but I'm trying to watch it on my phone
Disconnects many times
Love the app and love netflix in general. I've been having some problems with the app though. It freezes up on me in the middle of episodes and makes me restart the entire app. Just tonight I played one of the episodes and my netflix completely refreshed. Is there a way we can fix these problems???
Good
Almost there
Please make netbanking a payment method or UPI
Fuhhhh
"I'm sorry to see, mostly Mexican programs and movies, when there's a myriad of Latin American cinema (which includes Mexican films)."
Used to be easy to use. Now it acts funny when i get a call. Most importantly where did the casting function disappear to??
There are some issues with the pause time being recorded in both the website and the app but otherwise I like the product.
I have some issue when im searching for a movie or anime its not gonna show what exactly what iam looking for For example i search harry potter and the sorcerer stone its gonna show a different movie thats not raleted to the movie pls fix that
I have to monitor a lot.
I hate Netflix. I still watch it.

Doesn't work on my ZTE ZMAX Pro after the latest update

I never used it but my friends did
Ever since I updated it no longer keeps proper track of where I am at in an episode or even what episode I am on. This is ridiculous

See my rating ðŸ‘† ( don't try to install middle class people)
"i can't open the app anymore. I tried to uninstall and stuff but it's not working anymore. when I want to go on Netflix, the app is literally freezing on the black screen with the Netflix red sign"

"It keeps saying ""Too Many Downloaded Videos"" thus preventing me from downloading anything even when I'm the only one who has access to my account!"
Good
Fantastic
Ok
Make all movies available right now around the world so people could watch whatever they want.
"Everytime I want to watch a movie, the movies just freezes and the audio still plays. Can someone tell me when this problem will be fixed. Until then, I cant use netflix."
"Cannot play in HD on samsung galaxy A50s, even in official website this device support HD"
Netflix takes too much data
"I really enjoy watching Netflix but since the new update there is a feature where your device brightness and the app brightness are not paired anymore. This is extremely annoying especially when you where first watching in a darker environment and then later try to watch in a lighter environment, it is almost impossible to adjust the brightness to a suitable level. So please Netflix have an option to turn this off."
Its good season 6 of flash is not there so is just good
"I've used it before and it's good, but now every time I try to use it just kicks me off"
Hi good morning. Just a small issue I can't create a new account everytime I open the app it just go to home. Thank you for your response
Please accept paypal or paytm payments
When I have selected English language only why are you showing the films and TV shows in foreign languages if you don't have its audio in English please don't show it

Please dubb animes in hindi

I want the buddies though
The auto play is not working
Good
GLOBAL PRIORITY MESSAGE!! To Absolutely Every Netflix Department Staff! although likely nothing has been fixed with these recent months of updates! have decided to share with you that my thoughts go out to you during Global Covid-19 Pandemic! *** EDIT: not updated in at least 8'months now my review history explains why however now actually fear updating as could lose load of things! - massive amount of My List had totally vanished recently! really fear updating Netflix now! EVEN IF is fixed?
Bad
The price is too high for what movies and tv shows that are offered. When I search for a hit movie that is played on other popular apps Netflix doesn't have them. Need to get up to date movies and tv shows.
I used be able to call my girlfriend and we would watch shows together but after an update about a month ago we haven't been able to resume playing. It let's us pause but not play. It only happens while we are on call but that's when I mainly use Netflix.
"I had downloaded some episodes and movies, but after my subscription lapsed they were removed, no issue there but when I opened the app again it started redownloading them even though I had no subscription, the only way to stop was to log out of the app."
"Love this app except the fact that nothing is completely full screen, on YouTube I can make it completely full screen so why can't Netflix? So until Netflix fixes that issue I give this app only 3 stars."
***FULL SCREEN SUPPORT for playback*** please
Overall good but why keep putting things on that are old and frankly rubbish. then remove recently added things and keep the bad stuff. Not whatvinpaid up for.
Very good app
"Strange thing. After the new update, Netflix app refuses to play"
3 100000netfilx
Trouble connecting
Could you stop the pop up banner about asking me to refer people to use Netflix? It is annoying! And please make the search function better with more related category.
This App can't to open
"It is a great entertainment service, but it is costly as it costs INR 199 for 1 mobile but INR 499 for many devices, which is much expensive from amazon prime and disney + hotstar. I would say that it is great but costly after all."
Meh....
Fantastic
Every time i try to open app It crashes automatic .
App is good but there is somthing need to improve about app..like when i pause the content then i have to wait for their dispcription or name of the content and if i was wacthing a series i have to search about the episod which is actually i m watching..no description over the top or right or left side of the content..in chineese content please keep english audio along with the description..this is very important other wise the language very irretating while watching the content.
its good and all but on my laptop it glitches to much
Suka error server tidak bagus.
Everything is good. But the problem is I can't enjoy it properly because show like Naruto is present but the next part i-e Naruto Shippuden and Baruto isn't available in my region.
Ok

Payment update processing failed i am not able to take monthly package
I cant open my netflix app... It always show me to choose my account but than it going out from the app.
"There is a bug interfering with Oneplus devices , After playing the content the controls on the screen which we use to forward or play and pause were not going when I tap on display they are literally irritating I need to tap on lock button every time to get rid of it. Even I tried to uninstall the updates but not working properly.Hope you could fix the issue"
Please add English dubbing and all seasons of anime too. Many anime are not in English and not even dubbed. Please add . It will be much fun and also a 5star rating.
"The app runs smoothly when not playing videos. While playing any video irrespective of whether it's downloaded or streaming, it breaks and displays pixels and green boxes. I know it's occuring only with the One Plus series of phones, but I think Netflix could look into this. Everything else regarding the content is fine."
"So, i love Netflix iv been paying for about 4 or 5 years now. But you guys have to keep up i soon as i find a good show theres only like a a few seasons but the show acaly has like 9 seasons and Netflix has 3 or so. And that get really anoing also its been crashing like crazy one lately and there been a problem with the shows where i exit Netflix and then get back on it i have to try to find my place again. So fix that 5 stars."
I don't usg
"I love it when it works, so not right now."
Enable multi-window again!
Shi app haiii
I hope they bring out Jojo's Bizarre adventures season 2
Sorry for the 3 star review but the animated serial great pretender the translade audio in English doesn't work is in Japanese.
should decrease the price find it costly
I love netflix!
Too expensive
"Netflix is good all in all, The quality of Movies/series all good. The reason that i dont give 5stars because some of anime are not full episodes, can you please put all the episodes Thats all thanks"
"Netflix in general gets a 5 star from me, however, a recent change in the app has removed my ability to pause and play while on a call. I watch exclusively on my phone and sometimes watch the same thing at the same time as a friend or loved ones who are long distant. It helps me sync up manually. Please bring that ability back."
"Have uninstalled Netflix, but will get you back some time in the future.â˜º"
"Easy to use, please add dislike button so the movie i don't like won't appear in popular search"
Tem q melhorar muito
It sometimes doesn't work but when it does it's cool
Unstable
Idk not enough anime
SÃ³ pq cancela minhas sÃ©ries favsðŸ˜”
It's pretty good but sometimes it won't have the first few seasons of something but it'll have season 4 and 5. Not really any point in that is there? If your going to have something have all the seasons!
I need hindi doves will I get
"Great selection, suggestions, sync, UI, player. Unfortunately, there are times when the player gets stuck at loading, and an unhelpful error code is given. (5.2, 5.7, 5,10)"
Great app! But the issue I had was they don't get movies on Netflix first thing. They still don't have movies that came out 5 years ago. Other wise I love this app it's great! So please bring out more movies and tv shows! I also noticed once in a while it will log me out of my account I don't know why but please fix that!

"Landscape mode for menu would be nice. Since my phone broke I can't sign in. App design ok, but broken phone folk need landscape and search engine could be better. Over all 3*"
It's good but I miss many movies ðŸ±
"It just shut down anytime, showing an error code. That makes no sense, in the middle of a movie. Apart from that it's a good apps."
Give new episode as fast as posible pls you are 2 slow
I keep getting an error 1023 .. could not reach Netflix service. Sometimes it fixes on its own.. sometimes takes a longer time.
â¤ï¸
When you're gonna release series or anime please complete it.
Can you guys tell me why the legend of korra is not out yet you guys said it would be out at august 14
"Why if I download,the Indonesian subtitles are always missing !"
Nice
Can you make it free please?
The app is constantly freezing
Content Quality is degrading day by day of Netflix flop and bad acting webseries without any good story line
"Good app but uses a lot of memory. Also if there were more ways to organize, like playlists, and ways to search it would be nice. Also warn us before u remove content please. They do back a lineral agenda, but its ok I guess. I know they have watch later and continue but we should have more. Also maybe if u could rate movies by dtars instead of rhumb up or down? Idk, just a thought. Good value for the price though, and original content to boot."
Netflix your Netflix get your s*** off my Play Store no one hell no one's going to pay for $15 a month just to use your goddamn Adam so take it off Play Store and never show yourself back on it supposed to be for free and no one should have to pay for it but I want you to tip your f****** s*** off of Play Store and shove it up your ass.
Bad shows
an ok movie streaming platform
Your app update message is pretty condescending. Frankly I do worry about how you are changing the experience and want to know what is different before opting in.
"It might be my internet speed, but some shows pause and freeze."
You need to stop porn business
Very nice apps
There is a black bar when I watch videos on full screen in 21:9 so there is no real full screen. My phone is running android 10 with gesture navigation on.
I like Netflix but i ran out of shows and I think that going to Canada is kinda to extrem just to wach Naruto Shippuden can you please just let us wach all the other contres shows has to offer
I wish there were more series of like enc.dance moms kardashians and below deck bcs there are mostley kids stuff on there
After the new update I can't see any movie or serial cover photo... 95% of them are blank... Kindly fix it
Ok
Don't cancel the society I have been watting for season two to come out for forever!!!!
"The offline/download option is terrible. There are always error messages, you need to try multiple times to get a movie you dowloaded to work."
"It's always unable to play video so I have to restart my phone every time just to make it work. I think it's not compatible with EMUI? Idk, for reference I'm using Huawei P20 Pro with Android 10."
Ok lah... More tech documentaries please
"i personally love this app, so I wanted to install it on my Xiaomi mi 3s, but it showed options to log in, like (my email) and (my phone number) so I selected my email and it crashed :( please help)"
Good
"I have few problems about netflix, first,everytime I stop watching the drama/movie, of course we have to pause it, but when I open to watch it again, it starts from the beginning of the episode,there should be a continuation not repeat from the beginning. Second all the movies and dramas that been watched but not finished must appear on the home page, not that you have to search the drama again."
Nice
Nice
"Netflix is great! But, there are'nt any marvel movies... The only marvel movie there is, is spider man far from home and I have already watched it 13 times so it is getting kinda boring:/ If you can, pls add more marvel movies thx:)))"

Unable to open the app..! Kindly help ..!

Entertainment
Good
There's a really weird glitch where I load into the app and it shows me all of each My emails I have saved but when I click on one of them it just closes the app instead of signing me in
"Isn't optimised for tablet's, as a result many good movies are not included or missing?"
can u add a button where we pick what video quality we want?
Happy Ganesh chaturthiðŸ™ðŸ»

Stressful to log in
Elaine Thomas I get to watch the best movies love â¤ï¸ Netflix
"Good content, good app, ttpi metode pembayaran terlalu sedikit :("
Wish Netflix would let you see previews to see what the show or movie is about not just a small description
Need new movie
"It is a good app ,but I dont really care to watch movies. So I ain't on there alot. But it is a good app as long as I have had it."
"It's a good tv watching app, but it's angering whenever it asks if you're still watching. Please fix this I really hate it."
jvmnb
Not sure
Great app. Tons of content.
Has alot of great movies
It is the best movies and TV shows at a great price
Easy to use n understand
Its great
Very good experience
"The rating which I have given is purely for the rich n diverse content this platform provides having said that of late I am facing particular issue with the user experience on this OTT while streaming the app is frequently stopped almost 5-6 times even more in a day and a error message pop up ""device is not connected"" it just too irritating and nuisance see if u can help resolving this matter."
Netflix is real great and adding some amazing shows and movies to watch but on the other hand its also taking away good movies like Harry Potter. It would good if it kept all the movies but otherwise great app
I love it but add the old things back
"I would like you to add a feature that would allow us to download more episodes right from the download area for example if I'm watching S1E4, I don't have to go back to the search bar to search for the series and then download E5, instead while watching S1E4 in downloads there should already be option to download E5"
Alot of choices
"Cool, I like jwo it can give you notifications for shows youd like or that have just come.out. the screen is very dark though, so maybe an even brighter screen option? I have the dial all the way up but especially in dark scenes I couldn't see a thing but when watching on a TV I could see everything. Love the app though! Also love the download feature! :)"
It's good
Good app. No problems and clear picture.
"Im in love with Netflix but I think that you should be able to show your not interested in some films or series as my two favourite series have been removed. They are Miranda and Jonathan Creek. Apart from that I highly recommend it as it is full of funny, horror, thriller, British, sitcoms, etc."
It streams good
Love!!!!!!! It
Great
Stopped working with picture in picture?
"Great Collection. Netflix does a good job at suggesting shows similar to a particular show. But it simply fails at recommending content personalized to my taste. On home screen, it always does the same few shows all the time."
"Everything ok, but at night screen brightness is lot for me, after the update which have a brightness controler on screen. I watch a movie with minimum brightness level, after that also a lot of brightness for me, please do something for the solution."
"I can watch a lot of things, but I always have to go to Soap2day to watch what I want to watch. Some people like the old stuff like the jungle book. No offense but it's like you just throw perfectly good movies in the trash and get the new ones. But everything else is fine. Thank you."
Nice video
I rated a 4 star because pick it up you can watch stuff on it but you have to pay for it.
Happy
"Their are many movies, shows, documentaries etc to choose from. There are movies from all ove the world. The only problem is there is a limit on how much you can download which is bad if you plan on going on long hour road trip, so if there is another update plz change this."
".The biggest advantage of this is that you can watch many types of information and movies from around the world, as well as series online And it also features Indian series and American series as well as many country series and films. LUCIFER TEEN WOLF THE PROTECTOR THE PUNISHER JESSICA JONES FAST AND FURIOUS : ALL PARTS AND MANY MORE .... Just I Love It..."
great almost as good as funimation
Its amazing and shows most things no breaks no nothing. The only issue is that theres a couple of things rhat arent on there.
Very new customer
Cant live without my netflix! Lots of good movies
Nice
Although I love Hulu; Netflix has tha flicks!!!!
Just its on your phone

The app is really good. Would be great if you can add an option to see the content in 1.5 speed

Easy to access but limited movies and shows

It's awesome but the only problem I find with it is it doesn't have everything I'm searching for.
I'VE NEVER COMMENTED ON THIS APP??

Very good app
App is super but searching for content not on display
"U need to put more old shows on there like Cory In The House, That's So Ravon, Danny Phantom, Back At The Barnyard, and Lizzie McGuire!"
I love Netflix but as of the new update everytime I watch something the video puase but the audio continues. Don't know why but its does bother me a bit.
"It's not perfect, there is still a room for improvement."
Cool
just really nice thanks for that
Can't log on...fix the problem and I'll change my ratings
Great app
Sometime this apps can use and sometime cannot use. Its happened always.
"Doesn't have some of the series and movies it claims to have on google search, but still pretty good."
I give it a 4.5 i miss my shows
I really like the app but i dont like when we are really getting into a series and it gets taken off of Netflix. Also i wish they would put more seasonal movies on. Example halloween and christmas movies.
Some movies are only on some regions which make it sucks!
PUT SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS ON NETFLIX
Great viewing
i dont like it all the way because it does not have the wizard of oz
It may cost but that prevents the FBI for braking down your door my only complaint is cuties just dude you might as well pay a pedophile to follow the kid actors
ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg no ass
Ok
Jus the best yet.
"Exceptional, master piece."
Nice app guys
I love the movies
"Plese put resolution setting on the app 240,360 etc not everyone has a great internet package"
Satisfactory
It's a great way to watch movies when you're Offline Cause you can download on and when you're all mine you much all these great movies and series and shows.
ðŸ‘
Awesome

Indian web shows are not so good but it is ok netflix have so much entertaining contain
Good just needs to add some better shows
"La aplicaciÃ³n no estÃ¡ funcionando como deberÃ­a, sin importar la calidad del dispositivo o ancho de banda hay contenido q no carga nunca"
Super
"The recent update has a glitch or something. There are times I want to skip forward, it wouldn't let me. Or the video just freezes. So I would have to drag it forward"
Exellent app
Great app. 100% user friendly
I LOVE this app but the problem is it keeps non coming compatible with my phone and then non-compatible unless I uninstall it so that's why im giving this a 4-star.
It has been good I watch what I want to without commercials .
There are some shows which I want to see but only few seasons are there ðŸ˜”

"Please fix chrome cast it's not working, on other apps it's fine but with Netflix it always shows connecting"
App does not work when connected to wifi. my service provider assured me it is not an internet issue. so stupid
Its a great app but there is not enough anime
Good
I would prefer a better player interface..
EnglishSubtitles problems
The best but i need more riverdaleðŸ’ŸðŸ’Ÿ
Good
I love the Application! There are so many shows and movies but most shows are not there because I don't live in Japan sadly like there are not that much animes because it's only available in Netflix Japan..
Could have more movies that the lips match the mouth n words
Didn't had many hindi movies And had only web series
Four stars since you didn't add all of the my little pony equestria girl episodes
Its great
Its automatically closing.. when im opening.
"Whenever I'm repeating a series, the continue watching feature doesn't work properly. Hope developers could fix it. And thanks for including playback speed."
Good
"Awesome and easy to use. Chromecasting can get annoying, though."
"Everything is working great along with the latest UX update but the only reason I kept one star to myself because after update, the streaming seems to get stuck and loops while scrolling forward. Well I admit the network is not excellent but then again it has a tendency to auto adjust the quality and then again I'm not the only one with that kind of problem. So fix it because believe it or not it's annoying ðŸ˜–."
Best app
Fifth update and still no Chromecast fix. All other apps on phone still cast. This is appalling! I haven't used via phone in months.
Amazing app
great
"Good, but should add more Bollywood new movies"
Simple functional.
"Why do u have to pay for a specific amount of people to be on, it's annoying and my family doesn't have the money. Why can't it be like every other movie thing."
Amazing
âœ¨â­ðŸŒ 
Good app
I like Netflix movies and TV shows
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Good app maybe add some more old movies to the app and anime as well but overall really good app for watching movies
Please add another payment method.
"All good, don't worry bout Harry n Megan, what about more pinkey blinders and Ozark..."
Loved the app until all of a sudden it got rid of the pop out window or even the option to view the app in a split view screen. Why?! it was a vital feature! I just deleted it.
You took my favourite movie off.. :'( Leap! Was a great movie...- Other than that I love this app
"This app rocks! At first I was hesitant to buy subscription because of its price. But then my mausi advised me to sell kidneys if I wanted to buy subscription, I had to sell both kidneys because one is not enough. Never regretted my decision,watch movies, webseries. This app produces best webseries in every case but there is one problem though..MAUSI is no more:-("
Very nice experience to the children of all the age groups.
Good
Please add more anime theres not enough
Love it
Good app . Best video quality even on 2g . A SUGGESTION:- YOU SHOULD ADD A POPUP TO SHOW THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS FOR LOGIN.
Good
Some Basics of the App should be improved like In landscape mode when swiped left or right we should forward the vid by 10sec
It could be better if ther was more stuff to watch
best
Great app
Entertaining
Ok
Good
"This is a good app but when I was about to watch pretty little liars I couldn't watch it, Netflix stop taking shows and movies off of Netflix"
"Love the app. Though one issue i had is after watching a certain episode(offline), most of the time it would play the oldest episode. Not sure why it is happening"
I kinda like this but want more adam slander's movie... ðŸ˜
Sometimes it logs me out of my account but other than that it works just as well as ant thing else
"Please, Grimm again on Netflix. Please!"
Good
Color brightness
The app gets crashed in between sometimes
"Can't keep up with the download sequence of a series, skips some episodes and download episodes from other series"
ðŸ‘Œ
Little slow
"I like no love this app but I think it needs more LGBTQ+ like Don't Look Deeper,bring back Pretty Little Liars I would watch it 2 times,Love Sam,or love Kevin or any LGBTQ+ cause most shows are getting boring and I have never seen any trans movies."
simply the best solution for boredom
Awesome app
Works good
Best thing when looking for sunm to do.
I'd like to suggest for an option to browse all available movie from chosen initial letter and an option to resize the subtitle to smaller or bigger font. I love to watch netflix but then again. There's a lot of things that I think could've been better.
V good
"Easy to use, and binge watching is awesome !!! Definitely my favorite app."
This is a good app to use at home but I wish you could use it when you have no wifi because you have to download films but it only let's you download so many
This is a good app but on problem is that u have to pay for it every month.
Good but needs more movie and shows
"I love netflix, just wish maybe it was a bit cheaper, and had more series like some of my favourite TV shows aren't on there and only some series are on there like series 1 of something but theres no series 3 when there is on anything else, but I still love Netflix amazing for binge watching easy and reliable"
Nice
I like netflix but only 1 problem there is to much update so that means I have to updated like alot of times
Great
More to learn in world nearby Netflix
Great
It's the best. But they just have to work on getting new things faster
"Mostly a good app, lots of cool shows to binge with a low price, but the most infuriating thing is that they got rid, of DIGIMON, all they have now is either fusion (horrible) or NOTHING!!! I would like Digimon back"
Like glitch tech
"I've watched a lot of Netflix. We all have. Lol I download at Wi-Fi hotspots and watch at home where I do not have Wi-Fi. Never watch T.V. No cable or whatever. So, one thing I wish Netflix would accommodate we viewers with is info about if what we are about to download is in English language or not. Yeah, yeah, I know subtitles. But, the subtitles run too fast and miss half the dialogue anyway. Delete. Time wasted. Lol"
Very nice app
I give it 4 stars because twoday it did not let me in and I love it so much that I cried ðŸ¤­but apart from that I'm downloading it now and this app is were I found all my favourite moovies *I'm addicted*
Not bad
Great when working correctly.
Sooo fun
"I think that this app is, overall, very enjoyable, but they could have more shows and they should learn to know when to drop a netflix original. If you're running out of ideas, guys, don't try to push it. You've created a mastermind of a TV show, but it can't go on forever. I found that with some netflix originals were amazing the first two seasons, but then it was just like they'd given up or run out of ideas or something. Overall, good experience though, so well done Netflix!ðŸ‘ðŸ‘â™¥ï¸ðŸ˜›ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
Good
Excellent
Gud
Netflix please provide yearly plan for India.
Rip
Was gonna rate it 5 stars but then cuties came
I love the varity of movies and tv sellections.
Every now and then Netflix will sign out and I have to sign in which is annoying but other than that it's great.
"It's really good I can find almost everything, there's still some stuff I would like to see added other then that I love it"
â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
Siddu

Sometimes it will have a show but not all of it but still good

Its a very good app for movies and series but they have only two payment credit which is credit card and debit card.They should add more like PayPal and MTN mobile money payment services.
Still good to use after all this time me and my family keep coming back to it. Lol.
Good
Nice app
Good
Good good good! Expensive but worth the price
Zip zed z
Is good but I wana watched anime but almost all the anime shows are Japanese and i don't like to read so 4 star
"After the new update , the screen freeze so often , that i have to close and open the app"
"The best hard to beat,good stuff good line up,"
No point to your app if you cannot display the list of shows I already spent my time searching for and adding. My queue wad present in earlier versions.
Nice
Everything is ok and nice
app is not being open since an hour
"It's Netflix on your phone. 'Nuff said. I would give it 5 stars if I were allowed to watch everything available in English or English subtitles, and if they made finding stuff to watch easier. I dont know what all they have, so it would be cool if I could browse the whole library."
"So far so good. The only annoying thing is that if I leave the application running in the background for less than 2 minutes, I have to restart the application to continue what I was watching. Also the continue what I was watching feature is not always accurate. Sometimes it is not updated and I have to forward manually."
Super Duper Fast
Too long between Seasons that are too short lol
Amazing aap
Sometimes black screen... And sometimes sounds comes before the video
Find app ok
Needs more anime like naruto
No words... simply awesome
1point cutting for expensive plan
Nice not bad
This app used to work. It doesn't show the episodes you've watched. Fix this problem because it's annoying.
Please make pokÃ©mon available to stream
Great entertainment for the family

My favorite streaming service i just wish they would put rhinestone cowboy with Dolly Parton and Stallone on it lol
Need more quality update movies
Great
Make Full HD available in all devices please. It sucks to watch videos in SD on mobile.
Just amazing. You can find almost every movie you can imagine. The old movies that are hard to find is a real treat. The only downside isball the ads that are the same thing over and over
It's okay but I can't watch it on my smart TV because it's a JVC I can only watch it on my device... Now I have to make a way to buy a Samsung smart TV
Picture in Picture no longer working!
I rate it 4 because I wanted to have pokemon journey
"Awesome app! It allows you to download Movies and TV Shows. Unfortunately for devices that have ALOT of storage, Netflix has to put a download cap to it. Netflix, if you can read this, please put a larger download cap than just 30 TV shows on a same title and 4 movies. It should be larger. Like at least add more than 10 titles of all the seasons and at least 20 movies. Other than that, it is a pretty good app!"
â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸
Works. Though wish you could watch on the phone and TV at the same time 12 bucks a month is ridiculous for one device only. Customer service is great tho.
"good app, but you have to pay for it only down side"
"i enjoyed watching t.v shows & movies on netflix but I do hope netflix would bring back the old ones such as buffy the vampire slayer, ally mcbeal, ugly betty, popular & fringeðŸ˜Š"
Good
just like the variaity to watch all kinds of differnt movies
need more series
"To cast on Samsung TV, I have to put 2 pincode, one in phone and other on TV"
All good but don't have some movies i wish there was harrypotter on there and then it would be a 5 star app i would love if you added it to neflix

"Netflix and the app are Awesome..! BUT there are some glitches. 1.) It doesn't ""resume"" properly.. Once paused (or at end of an episode), in time it resets to default home page while screen mirroring. Upon pressing ""resume/play"" were you actually left off, it either takes you to a previous episodes altogether or an earlier time within cureent episode. 2.) You can finish episode and go back to default home screen and it takes a long while to reflect actual next episode."
Nice

"I love that there are no ads. It is very nice, but my only issue is the price. It is pretty expensive, but over all a great app."

I like the app but i dont like how the app have s alot of sÃªasons and episodes missing on alot Ã² shows so i give it 4
Great!! I wish I had Disney + though!!
"Have had no problems with it so far. Only annoying thing is when there are updates. All other apps let us know what updates we are getting. This is a paid service and I would like to know what is being updated. Really annoying when I see that ""You worry what to watch next..."" message next to my updates. I want to know what you are updating."
I uninstalled  and reinstalled but there are times that the movies/series doesnt load. Been waiting for about 30 mins and it still says loading ðŸ˜¢.. heeeelllppp
Everything is Good but I suggest to upload the complete episode and complete season because the other episodes that are uploaded are not complete season so may I suggest please upload the complete season of every episode.
We always forget the email and passward

Netflix is a really good app but my only issue is that it glitches quite a few times bu other than that it's really good.

Good app but it's costly
Would like more variety of movies I much like what you have but searching older movies no result.

"The only thing a dislike is that if you have someone else's account on your device,and they have too many downloads,you can't download anything.Pls fix this"
"App works great, but I don't like the idea of not having shows that is available in other countries. We paid for the subscriptions, so we deserve to watch every content that is available in netflix no matter the region."
Exceptional service and a wonderful experience for me
"Hi, I love this aap but there are some movies which are very hit and not in this aap ............I request to netflix to add more movies romantic comedy thrill horror sci fi and please also add this 2 movies 1. Evolution 2. Journey to the center of the earth Please add this movies"

"I give this app 4 stars for now because when sonic the movie comes out,Netflix has to put the prequel,so later they can also put the sequal,other then that Netflix right now ok for me"

"Does the app no longer automatically switch off when you are inactive.... I have had it play the whole night until morning without switching off, it previously did not do this, or is it my settings ðŸ¤·"

I LOVE this app but the only thing I don't like about it is that they took off lemonade mouth and Feel the beat I loved those shows please put them back on please.

"Perfect ,especially the part it has no bothering ads. I give it a 4.7 since am not very pleased with the series updating.. there are lots of hot Seies that are not available on netflix"
"Season 4 of NARCOS! Let's ROCK! and can we get a freakin ETA on season #3 of Ozark already, damn. And can you please list the englush speaking movies separately from the non-english speaking movies? It takes forever to scroll thru the lists why would you make people who speak any particular language scroll through movies they won't understand or watch?"

"I had a good experience but I wish Netflix had more movies and TV series esp. Seal Team, Buffy and Angel."
It's good and for sure a lot of people want this app for giving them a relaxing feels by watching ðŸ˜ðŸ˜Š
The streaming service is top notch but the there's a flaw the animes are not available in dubbed version
nice app. but the best when the ads would be away
My account was hack and it was used by some other person who I don't know even I changed the password. Sign out all device is taking long time. It should me done immediately. And take a look on the hacking of user ID and password

They need more anime
This app is really Good app OK
I LOVE WATCHING THE KISSSSSSSSSSSSSING BOOOOOOOOOOOOOTH
All I want is it to be free
More anime
Love it
Wide variety to select from. Though mainly old movies for my county updates in series nd new movies take so long.
They dont have that many movies that i want.
Not to good. Need more movies tha sopapra.
It's something that's all I know
Please release a miraculous ladybug episodes or new movies ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
"You've deleted alot of movies and shows I wish to watch again and there is not a lot of choices, two things I do wish is that you add my hero Academia on Netflix and also stop deleting movies and series."
I love how you can watch movies with no interruptions it's feels like amazing
Perfect for being in Quarantine.
Nothing better than netflix thats one for sure....the thing is i m an anime lover and your most animes dont have the english audio dub which is quite disappointing.
it is a great app to watch movies/tv shows on
I downloaded the app months ago but i started using it today. I was watching a movie and it just suddenly stopped. I also wasnt notified before i was charged and i thought first users were given one month free.
Wow love the app it is good but it drains my battery life fast.
It's very good in the way that its kinda like Netflix
Providing or confining shows based on geographical areas is a bitchy thing to do... Everyone should be able to watch all the shows/movies Netflix has to offer regardless where they live. Dafuq man?!
"Not having any issues atm, but one comment on the design. Why does netflix have brightness control on devices that have their own brightness control? It's actually pretty annoying and I haven't found an option to disable it. When I drag up my Home/Back button bar hitting the brightness slider is unavoidable. It's just an unnecessary piece of clutter."
Expensive
More anime plz
Its good
Good entertainment
The app needs a mute button
Brilliant thanks
"Little expense, content is good and one thing i need to say to netflix company that we are giving money to watch content present in netflix but why are you not releasing all the season in some series it upsets the viewers so consider about that"
"I have a problem with netflix because it says I have to use an account that is saved with smart lock, everything else is good"
whenever I use it it never lags or anything I love this app with all my heart
Awesome but logs me out alot
I'm of 24 years and I have only one debit card for now. So it's a humble request please make available with Rupaye debit card because I recently got to know Netflix don't allow subscription through Rupaye Debit card (INDIA).
Bom!
It just does not have every thing I want but it has most things I want
This app is awesome and is awesome but tends to log out Of my account and is very slow when using my home WiFi but that is the problem
ðŸ‘ðŸ¿ðŸ‘ðŸ¿
i like it
Great app but they need to fix this I was watching anime then it finished with 6 seasons but there are 8 seasons
Nice app
Good
They need to remove the show cuties
It's great. But not every movie is there or series. Especially Korean drama
I love this aopp but I fell 5hey could have more anime
"I am new to Netflix, especially on my phone. I get random notifications that say ""could be of interest to me"" umm.. not at all.."
Exceptionally good
Not bad

"So this little programme works well and there as been No problems to date, so happy. Good selection of films . Thanks developers etc"
Need different movies
Are you kidding me? All I see is a black screen with sound. No bug fixes since long
"Used to work... Now all I get is ""Netflix service cannot be reached"" despite every other device in my house having no issues whatsoever with the Netflix app. No biggie for me as I have alternatives, but others might not be so lucky."
"I've really had a great experience with this app up until now, hence me giving 4/5 star. But now I'm having the same issue another reviewer mentioned -1023 error. Just started after the newest Android update on my pixel 4"
Good
"A very good app to enjoy shows of different flavors.. however as of late, it's kinda becoming monotonous... hopefully they'll add a lot of interesting shows"
Great movies..
It is pathetic whenever I try to sign in it shows some notification and still it doesn't signin infact it has nothing to do with my net or anything else
I think there should be an option to turn off casting entirely or at least a confirmation of screen casting. The amount of times i accidentally casted to my tv and woken up my house is unreasonable.
Good
Almost good. But some basic movies that are available on other sites are not available on Netflix. Otherwise its fine.
I lov it ðŸ˜ðŸ¤ŸðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
"Great app, i am happy they have anime too . â˜†~ (>â€¢ Â°)"
Need new
It's a cool app to use...like it.
"Great app, wonderful service, 10/10 would allow it to ruin my social life with no hope for the future. :)"
"There is always ROOM FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT SO THIS IS MY RATING, also I don't know if it's the subcription and using but some movies Ive searched for I just can't see??!!!!! For what it's worth tho MA money is in good use"
"Netflix, I'm gonna be honest..you should really fix ""Are you still watching?"" Like I wanna watch my shows peacefully without getting interrupted by that question so.."
Good app.
Great
Good
The User Interface can be better.
Good need to get more shows.
Almost perfect but there's always room for improvement buddies.
Good
Good app for movie lovers...but need to improves it lists of film libraries whenever it's classics to present trends...
Nice
I like so much but..... i dont know hehehe
I LOOOOVE netflix.. there are just a few things about it. I think that movies should stay there for example i watch a movie in 2017 and now or a year later it is no longer there.
Pretty good alright...works for me!!!

"Everything is fine until I get a phone call and need to answer it or somehow I need to pause the show and move to another app, then when I get back to Netflix and I want to resume watching, screen is black. I can hear the show but can not see it. This continues like this until I close the app, reopen it and open the show that I was watching before. Please fix this issue."

"I like it other that the occasional ""device failure occurred "" or "" Netflix is unable to play the video"". Great if imdb rating is also mentioned alongside the movie description which would save me lots of click to get to google to know about its rating. Also if there is an Already watched section where all my watched movies are listed, it would be great. Currently watching section requires some work though, I am unable to delete the movies that are showing there although I have watched."
Great
Every thing is good buy I want to ask when you will add Avenger series to your collection ..I am eagerly waiting to watch those films....i request you to add them as soon as possible
Very nice

"On some phones with aspect ratio of 19.8(or higher):9 like my new device OnePlus 8 pro, the full screen mode remains below the punch hole camera. Full screen mode should be truly full-screen covering area beyond the punch hole camera. Edit: Latest update fixed the issue. Thankyou team."
Add halfscreen pls
"Finally, happy to see full screen video in notch"

"It might seem as if Netflix has all the shows but if doesn't. I would give it 5 stars if they add ICarly, Drake and Josh, and Zoey 101. Those were some classic and unique shows in my time. But I can't watch it now so it's kind of sad."

"I love this app and everything about it, thank you developers for such an amazing app, I dropped a star because I think that you gotta actually add ALL the seasons to each series...Example: Yugi- Oh originally had 3 seasons, but I was only able to watch 2 seasons...Anyway love this app!"
Nice
"I had uninstalled it and installed it back. After I installed it back, I couldn't get into the app. I don't know what's wrong. Is it bcz I didn't save the account in Google lock? Is there no way to fix this?"
Netflix lets you catch up your whole movie
"Some video have error I can't download it but after some time it works just fine, look for it"
I like app so much .. But I wish legacies was available in my country ... and some other movies. ...like spider man homecoming nd etc

"Can't set movies, shows or episodes manual without watching it"
Good
Just wish they had an option or was able to add new release movies on it for a small fee per movie.
Good platform to get busy in this pandemic situation...
Nice
"Imagine if this app had a comment section for each movie when watching?ðŸ˜…In my opinion this app is good it comes with a very good vibes but it doesn't carry the shows people most likely expect to be on here for instance black panther or spongebob or what men wants these I would look for but I know it's not there but otherwise this app is very useful, it comes in handy."
"I think that netflix is pretty great, but everytime you go to look up a popular title, it's never there. Just saying"
The only reason why i gave it a 4 stars is because it shows us the episode i have already seen so i get confused and even watch the same epi i have already seen.
"i hope you can add settings for subtitles. i wish to have it in smaller fonts sometimes, and please avoid all caps lock for subs especially in grey's anatomy, please work on it â˜ºï¸"
"Everything about netflix is amaizing! But some series' only have a few seasons. Not all of them in my country for example: Grey's anatomy has 15 seasons, TMNT has 2 seasons i hope that this will be resolved"
Alright
"Great app. Only one big problem, I have a Samsung A10S and in this phone there is no hd capabilities so everything I watch is SD which really sucks beacuse it can look very pixelated at times, and it really sucks beacuse in every other app I can watch HD content besides Netflix hopefully they update it so I can finally watch Netflix in HD quality."
It is pretty good.. It doesnt have much things to watch
Peepee poopoon't

"Pretty good choices, but not always up to date"
App sometimes doesnt load
Good
Very exciting watching first time
Beutiful app great shows but AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA it be many frustratings to traverse sumtimes
"1st app I download on a new device. Tons of movies and series to choose from. Biggest complaint is the price hikes. Started out less than $10/month, but now over $16 for the same service."
Nice
noice
"To a degree, Netflix has revolutionized our media consumption. I admire the variety of available content and the website and app interface. This is my first Google Play review, and I'm doing this only to point out that for many months now, I always have to restart my phone first before I am able to connect to Netflix. (All my other apps are working well, so it's not a connection issue). I don't know why this happens, but the problem persists even when I already have the latest app update."
The app is overall very good. But right now with the brightness function being a part of the app is not so great. At time when there's sunlight around I'm not able to watch any of the content cause the brightness is low even in high settings.
plz add more mcsm epiosodes and a little boring also ppl hate netflix on bsp so help
Good
It's keeps me occupied
Keeps loading and freezing but has really good movies
Stop removing content
Nice

Love it any time I am free I can continue my shows
I love this app though it could be better if they didn't segregate by region sometimes the movie I want to watch is not available in my specific region but would be available in another region allow full access to your Netflix library for five stars
Need more new movies ðŸŽ¥ from top rated actors in the United States

I have problems about this app cause you have missing episodes
I like this application! It has many shows that I've wanted to watch from a long time ago. But the only one problem is some shows I want to watch too are not available in my country. I hope those shows will be available on Netflix in my country someday!
Good app but it should be free

"I love it , you can find whatever you want to watch all kinds of entertainment but I can't find the Arabic subtitles of blacklist part 6"
Easy to access
Good
Great movie
It's really glitchy
Why does it suck so much battery these days. I miss when my battery percentage would remain the same after an hour of Netflix. Regret updating
"Much improved since I last reviewed. Finally we have the hyperlink tags that group content together, like cast, creator, genre and characteristical tags. Well done! Still missing the more extensive information during playback like in Prime Video and searching for a combination of the tags."
I really like it and it's easy to connect
"Please check why doesn't revert to the last scene I watched. It always go back to the start ie episode 1, especially for downloaded items."
Perfeito.
Nice

Why does it atamaticly take your money somtimes i forget to cancel a member ship and it takes away my moneyðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’¢ i hate this app you guys should add like at the end of the member ship or free trail it tells u of u wanr to continue or somthing then i would give 5 stars
Best experience. Please add a way to add custom subtitles when not available from your side. Thank you!

Netflix is becoming so low quality.
Netflix has been a great experience. Would like more recent movies though.

"We need more BLACK comedies. MOESHA, THE GAME GIRLFRIENDS, SISTER SISTER......WE WANT TO WATCH THIS CANADA TOO!"

Good
Very reliable
Okay
I like net flex
Not baad
I love Netflix just wish the down loads wouldn't expire and every day I have to figure out how to let me what movies and stuff and it is a pain in the butt
"It's good I guess, I just have to say, I properly close and stop my episodes each time I'm done watching, but Netflix says I'm on another episode when I'm not. Like it says I'm on episode 10 of season 1. When I'm on episode 1 of season 2. It's just really annoying to have to find my place each and everytime, and then I don't remember if I already watched a part or not."
Good
Night
4 stars because there's always room for improvement. I love the app so much and it's my go to app during this quarantine. The price is also reasonable. Downloaded it now!
Overall a pretty solid app. Missing a couple of features that I really enjoy on Amazon Prime though... primarily the ability to see who the actor is in a scene
Well I have Netflix Africa and there aren't as many shows
Amazing experience
Good
Nice app
Its gud
Great app
I gave 4 stars because sometimes I can't see the screen and it's annoying
User interface is good and smooth but the app has a lot of improvements to be done. My only issue as of now is that my phone supports QHD resolution So I should be able to watch the shows at 1440p but still I'm stuck at 1080p Rest everything is good better than some other streaming platforms I use.
Great
Good application for watching movie
Its ok
"Current: Working also on chromebook. (had to disable/enable android!) Previous: (solved) not working on chrombook/android subsystem. (used to work) Previously: (I think it is solved now) It is unacceptable to get notifications when you have ""allow notifications"" clearly marked as ""no"" or ""off"" in the app setting."
I want Netflix to have a remote feature since I haven't still login on my smart tv and my dog ate my remote i can login im hoping they can add a remote feature
The only issue is that it dosent accept paymnet though rupay cards
It's very annoying when image starts to lag and the audio continues!
Fantastic
Best webseries are found here
wish it has more movies and series I like
It's good but a wish there were more shows The show that I REALLY want to watch but it's not on NetflixðŸ˜¥
"It lets me watch shows that I funny, romance, and thiller"
Good happy with it
"9/18/2020 Netflix has been having issues with the screen. 3/5 of the time, when I pick a certain time for a show/movie to play, it'll freeze the screen, but play the audio. Even if I rewind or fast-foward the show/movie, it'll just make this entire big occur again. It's an great app, but please, if you can, fix this bug and, also, please add ""Samaria Jack"" . I forgot how to spell it, but thank you!"
Get more anime
I would have gave them a five but they need to add my fav movie back Bring it on in it to win it!!

I really enjoy Netflix.. I do fine I run out of show to watch maybe i watch to much tv I recommend Netflix
great time killer but it doesn't have everything released for every show for example the anime a certain magical ondex has 3 seasons and a movie but on netlfix you only find the first 2 seasons and the movie
Great but needs better and latest movies and anime series
Cool
Netflix won't continue to play in the background of my screen anymore
Enjoy Netflix but would like to see more modern movies
I would rate this app a 5 star but my only issue is that every time I come on it I have to get rid of the app and install it again so it works properly .

Good shows. Need to add movies more frequently.
I can fill my time with friend I love it
AWESOME
"Well i have to compliment Netflix for keeping me busy and for providing some entertainment... But to be honest I have to search and search for movies/series that I want to watch or when me and the wife wants to watch something diffrent the menu always stays the same. Im from South Africa but there is one Afrikaans title available, we try to watch a romantic comedy and all other generes is mixed in the search, i have wached all titles in your list provided and there is nothing new..."
Excellent
I like the movies
It's working again.
"They're good at what they do, but most movie series are in pieces because of competition with other streaming services. If Netflix had everything, or at least everything that used to be or is popular, this would be a 5-star rating."
"Please add anime BL series. Genres like the ones in Banana Fish, Given and Yuri on Ice. Or just the anime itself. Thanks."
new movies arent there for morocco
"I like the app, I don't have any issues, much better than my Crave app which lags all the time and the price isn't too bad either ! **Update** Whenever I use the app or another episode starts, I always have to stop and take the subtitles off, because they turn on automatically, this just started happening, about 2 weeks now, and I'm not very impressed ðŸ˜’ it's a bit annoying."
Ok
Please get some more interesting things to watch
Doesnt have icarly
"Smooth and simple, cant believe I've had netflix and only now discovered its amazing app on my phone."
Yeah boy
Great
Need some new movies
needs more movies
"There were a lot of interesting shows to watch, but soon I couldn't watch any since I had no more tv shows that I got interested at, and cuties should be deleted too."
Great entertainment
Great!
ðŸ‘
Its good for spare time.
Please put on more shows and not take off shows that people watch. Some of us bought netflix for certain shows that cant be found on cable
I like it but I really wish they had some old movies that never play on dstv like ratatouille
Why don't you add Chinese drama love a thousand years
Ok
I love this app. I have been using netflix for so long now. The only problem is that many of the movies/ series are not in latin language . Only subtitles are available which makes the experience boring. It would have been better if all the series and movies would have been available Latin dubbed as well. Rest everything is great about Netflix.
Great app but I know I'm not the only one wondering this when will you put the rest of the harry Potter movies on the app
The only issue I found is the home menu having fewer types of suggestions than on my xbox or roku or smart tv. Space vs variety
Nice
Ok
It yes
Auto play could use an up grade
Better than ok less then great overall degrees higher than soso
Me to switch their movies out more
i like it i get to see my show but they need more ncis show of the other one and more movie other then that it pretty good
Almost perfect. Tell whoever subtiltles the korean dramas that they ARE NOT CURSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ã·!!Ã·Ã·Ã·!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OR JUST GET SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT!
It was really good
It's addictive...
"It's expensive. So I unsubscribed it. Bsically, Vodafone exceeded my monthly bill just because of Netflix subscription"
Please make an option to subscription for time basis like 50 hours subscription 100 hours subscription etc etc
Worth of every single penny
"Each show needs a ""turn off intro permanently button"" nobody needs to hear ""the office"" intro song twice every 22 minutes. The app is good though."
"After the last review I got the app to work on my tablet by first logging on on a browser. Now it seems to be working well. ......................................... Downgraded from 5 stars to 1 star. Since the latest update it won't open on my Asus tablet. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it 3 times. The update has ruined the app. That said, on my phone and computer it's good."
Netflix l love you âœŠâœŠðŸ¤”ðŸ˜­
The best ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥â™¥ï¸
I couldn't screen cast in the app except that its all great
I love it
I would like if Netflix would add The Duke's of Hazzard tv show to the line up. It's a great show that many people would like to watch.
Very good overall.
Very good
Really great. Although the app keeps stopping.
We can't beat the quality
"It's great overall, but you guys should add a ""watched already"" or a similar kind of option to the app so that it doesn't recommend a series what someone has watched already with another account and the app gets a better idea to give good recommendations to the viewers"
I like it because there are good movies but aomw t u2j3ieieijejdudueheieueuwh WE NEED NEW MOVIEA WHICH ARE GOOD
"Please update payment methods like Google pay,phone pay"
I will say 10/10 I love netflix i love all of it but you need more anime series like Blood c and stuff (: ALSO im still waiting....for the new season of StrangerthingsðŸ˜¡ðŸ’–
Good
Very nice aap
Netflix is the best
this is a great app! the only thing is that most of the shows on Netflix are not there anymore like chi chi and the Godzilla earth movie series please bring them back.and tell this series called Kong king of apes that it is completely not fair that they can show bad dinosaurs.because most people like dinosaurs
This app is amazing i watch tv shows and movies on it everyday but when i go to bed and get up in the morning to continue with my movie it goes back to the beginning idk why but i like the app.9/10ðŸ˜

"It's great has a lot of brilliant shows and movies however there aren't as many as I'd like, for example Lucifer only has season 4 so its pointless and some of the latest seasons take years or don't get uploaded at all"
Very good app amazin selection but sometimes not very good quality

"The app is good but i didn't watch the whole series of pokemon sun and moon,please add all the episode and may you add big time rush because it's a great tv show fir family and children ppease add them.ðŸ‘"
A pretty good app just needs a bit more movies
I love this app wish you had better movie coming soon
It's cool but they need to add more anime
Really nice app but some seasons are missing
Rate is higher

Please add more anime then I will put 5 stars
"Yah i got it. Thank you. i have not checked out anhthinh yet,"
Awesome
Not enough tv series
"Great love what Netflix has accomplished,vast catagories."
"When the tv show or movie is not an original series, you cut it. I mean where can we find the next season of such movie if its not release immediately when new episodes were aired? Please don't be a cliff hanger. But overall, it's great."
Good V Good
Good And Best app
At first I downloaded Netflix and I had it for a while but then it disappeared ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Good
Thank you for restoring access to notifications.
Is this one correct?
"The app is good and working fine but i just wanna request some anime to be added like ""Millionaire Detective-Balance:Unlimited,AOT junior high,MHA(S4),etc. I would be glad if you just add thoseðŸ˜Š"
"It's great and all but their not going to add the new season to ""everything sucks"". :("
Best
I like this app alot!
"Toimii hyvin, mutta uusia kiinnostavia sarjoja ja elokuvia ei oikein lÃ¶ydy:)"
"They have variety, but after you binge watch shows you find that the variety slims"
q Ada n1
Some translations of the anime subtitles is not accurate.
U can add info about the actors
Good
This app was amazing but
Good appp
I really like the app
"Infinitely better than Hulu. Netflix is the mirror that shows Hulu that it is a clown with a dysgenic brain. Netflix is all you need, don't use Hulu."
Beautiful
I did not give it 5 star because all movies are of money not free
it helps me to rid my boring time off and the series are addicted
I really love this app it's just that I have watched most of the shows on here. And it takes a while for Netflix to have new shows and movies.
Good response
"My only issue is asking me to sign in to watch a download ,,,,I download so I can watch when I'm not in WiFi so that defeats the purpose"
i love Netflix but they need more seasons on some shows to be honest other from that its all good!:3
Great movies
Why is it that it always starts on a episode that I watched 3 episodes before its irritating
I think it should be able to be in vr
Ok
"Good overall, but gets movies late and has horrible horror movies."
Nice
It was good but the only thing I dont like is the put a series on there that's not a Netflix production on they put the first season of the show but they do not follow threw with the second
Good
This is a great app you can watch a lot on her but the only bad things is the lag
I like Netflix very much
"It's really good, though sometimes it kicks me out"
Good
Great
The only thing that I can't understand is that why netflix don't have library facility for its content so that we can see all the movies and series like Amazon prime and disney hotstar.
"App, could be better. It needs ability to request new titles."
We need more NEW movies! 4 stars for this...
Please add 'The great dictator' & 'the devil wears prada' to Netflix. ðŸ¥º
Good
I think netflix is a 3
Not everything is available
Had it for years. So it's like family now
"Excellent app. But after the last update , I am facing some glitches like the program or shows are not loading . Only after rebooting the phone ,Netflix is loading"
"After watching episodes of some series, the progress is not saved so when I come back to watch the next episode from the ""continue watching"" section it plays the same episode I already watched."
error watching offline videos
Good service though a lot of good programes arent on there.
Pip mode is highly unstable.
Tufj
I had this on my other phone but now it won't install no matter how many times I tried
it makes me wanna see me that's why I love it

Good

"Amazing app, but i wanna watch season 3 of pokemon sun and moon i wanna finish it but there are only two seasons i really wanna watch the last season it'll be awesome when you'll add it btw i live in phillipines incase its not there because of the region im in thank you."

Nice app but there's some intrusting serie i can't find on it
U should add after we collied and legices onto Netflix
This is great
Good
"It would be nice if the app had a speed setting to adjust the speed of a movie, cause sometimes one doesn't have enough time but wants to finish a movie or an episode. And also please add some more movies I know there a re lots already anyway. The related searches don't help that much"
Aaaassssa@@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa Bbbbb Nnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmmmmmmm Mmm
Just can't explain about this app its just amazing ðŸ¤©â¤
"It will not connect my galaxy s5, but it works fine on my galaxy s4 there for only 2 stars for now"
I like this app for watching cooking shows but why i rated it 4 stars becuase it got rid of my altime favorite show That 70's Show ðŸ‘¿. I haven't been watching Netflix lately because of this.
Every time i open the Netflix app it does not go to the home page and even my profile picture
Good
It good so far but I was wondering can you put the sons of anarchy back up there because i really want to watch it.
Love it
Needs ppl to download more stuff
"Although I enjoyed this app I have deleted it and canceled my account. I am very disappointed and disturbed by the response to the ""movie"" cutie. It is porn. Child porn and Netflix should be ashamed."
Great great movies
Love this app
I am very pleased with my tablet but not with my TV network it is coming up to four weeks and still can't get it on ðŸ˜£
It need more anime then 5 stars
"I use this all thee time, it's great"
"The app was really amazing and helpful but gradually, I started to experience inevitable errors. When I open the app after first downloading it, it is fine. On the second day however, it says that I have to sign in all over again, but the problem persists. I have tried all the directions to stop this issue on Netflix website; only uninstalling and reinstalling the app works. This is a very annoying issue. I am wondering whether it is to do with my device type:a SamsungGalaxyJ6.Thanks. gr8service"
There is just no enough good amount of series & movies
i personally have never had any issues with netflix itself but i do wish there wasa wider spectrum of movie/show selections
"Love this app for the most part, I do wish you could have more new recent releases"
Great
Please add how to train your dragon:the hidden world
"It would be great if they add ""mark as seen"" option because there are lot of movies and tv series in my recommendation which i have already watched."
Alright

Just would like to see more movies and shows a lot of things i'd like to watch are not on netflix
"No video on nexus 7 2013 android 5.0.2, have audio just no video"
Bagus sih..tapi rada kurang lengkap koleksi seri dan film nya. Mudah2an kedepannya bisa lebih komplit lagi
"Dear please update it's update amount system it's really a headache while recharging it, it's take a lot of time to recharge"
I wish there was option for streaming resolution rather then high and low
"Hey Netflix Team, do provide fast forward for 5seconds too. It wil be great"
My best friend in lockdown! 4/5 stars but I wish we could rate the episodes and series. :)

this app good for playing movies
It's a great service and now I can really watch Netflix wherever I want. The content is top notch and the AI seems on the money for my recommendations. More please! The Chromecast option is outstanding too. The viewing progress indicators are still a little confusing though.

"Good app, 4/5 user friendly , 2/5 for options. I would like a wider range of films, tv shows & sitcoms offered please. Offer more movies & tv shows, older & newer, that maybe weren't hits but were still good, Fools Gold with Kate Hudson & The Sum of All Fear with Ben Affleck are just 2 examples of great shows you aren't showing, please bring back all the media you can to help us keep our sanity. Thank you for all your hard work & dedication Sincerely a desperately bored but grateful customer!"
"Great quality TV and Movie streaming, my only issue is with what is actually on here, folks, dont watch Cuties."
Evreything is nice but the quality of the screen not hd
"Great app but when i started searching Steven universe it was not there but in Google it said its there,but rather than that its a great app i love itðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ"
Wow

Very quality picture
Not really have all the movies. But the quality of the video is superb! Also have download site so u can watch offline.
Goog
It's the best you can get at the moment. But few issues after recent updates pause and play later is having trouble working properly. A bit unstable right now. Eagerly waiting for He-Man Masters Of The Universe Netflix Original Series.
Awesome
"Never watched movies in this app,but I don't know why I rated,just I came to play store and when I saw the app I downloaded it and rated it now.ðŸ˜…"
i want to see kurulus usman all seasons like ertugul ghazi seasons
Netflix Is a great app the only problem for me is that they that way to long to bring out movies or series that have been out for more than a 6 months or more.
"I'm trying this app one more time, hopefully it will be as advertised, because I've become addicted to my Disney+"
Yeah its not free and i don't have money to buy subscription so thats why i gave 4 stars ... ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢.
Often unconvenient
"Love, but when rating movies it would be nice to be able to click on popcorn kernels rather than just like or dislike."
"It is good ,only thing I don't like it's the there not many new movies...I have almost watched all of them."
LOVE THE APP! can u plz readd Sharknado?
Please add more anime I really love Netflix but I'm gonna rate it 4 star
Excellent experience but would love if Beta program was reopened
Very good service
A good app. Hopefully there would be free trials in Nigeria soon.

"I mean, I guess that app is OK but it takes forever to load:/"
Liked the app v much. But the thing is that it lacks the number of Indian content. I mean in terms of movies. It has a fewer number of South Indian movies compared to other streaming platforms.

"I love the new feature of increasing or decreasing the playback speed! It let's me watch just a whole lot more in the same amount of time. I love it, Netflix."
Its a great app really but the one thing that i dont like the most is when they remove series or movies like i just came back from school and all i saw was one thing on my continue watching and i was in the middle of a series and all i saw was nothing and you removed my favorite series to so please do something about this and you almost removed half of the anime series i was watching and please stop removing series and when ever i try to search things up on i always get exited from there
I find that Netflix is very useful. Anyhow when I have bad wi fi I can't wach it properly.
Nice
My continue watching list is not showing up what should I do ? Please fix this problem !

There is no other option for payments. Either a debit card or credit card can be used.

"Why does de LG G7 has HDR and my LG V50 dont??? I want support for my devices, i pay for the ultra hd content, i would be grateful if you update.."
I have no problems with it
Easy for children to use and movie hop and show hop around.
"Doesnt work ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Great!
They have some really great shows and movies but they need to release them quicker than they do now.
love all the movie opinions
It's a pretty good app to watch movies/shows. My problem is the selection. There are not too many shows I like on it therefore its trash.
It amazing but there's very little Acton moves
i love dis app so much
CHIQUITITAS
Like it
Not satisfied with membership
great service but the app still can be better..
Its good ðŸ‘
"The continue watching thumbnail never gets it right!! Example: I'd be watching episode 5, but the thumbnail would be stuck on episode 2 and continue the episode from there! Very annoying!!"
"they should add rick and morty, or some decent shows for once."
I love Netflix I never got Netflix so I am going to try
The only reason I gave it a 4 star is bc yall took off that 70s show ðŸ˜’
They need to upload series like baby daddy and more telugu movies...
It's don't have all movies but it's cool
Great app. I wish they had a better selection of old black and white films but they do have a ton of hidden gems.
Good
not all the shows that are projected in other countries are shown in Lebanon which is quite unfair and the shows that are there not all the seasons are added. other than that all is good
"Latest update brought lotsa bugs instead of fixing them. Lost connections, disappearing info in status bar. #After couple of new updates (bug fixes?) it's now even worse! Disappearing status bar after ~1 minute. Come on i want the version back from 3 weeks ago. That one worked... #Moto Z play and Chromecast EDIT 22-04:  Still no normally working app. Fix it! It'sâ€‹ been more then a month now since the app did what it should do. EDIT 29-04 The new ""Bug fix update"" still doesn't work"
Swag
Needs newer movies ðŸŽ¥
Error problems
Ok
Not alot of series like avatar
"You should apply a password protection on the way to access the ""account"" option through browser too,anyone can access it and watch who ever's watching what,and also don't show to people which maturity rating or if any title restrictions are applied to any profile,to see them apply another password protection,do some thing please,these 2/3 things will help a LOT!! please"

"While I love this app, the new updates have made the playback feature on downloaded movies horrible. I've been getting a notice 10seconds into watching a movie that there's an error with playback. Other than that this is an amazing app"
Very good
I loved the app. Was nice to have. Like the download options for later use as I go out of reception a lot. Pretty sad that there are still examples of the sexualization of kids on this app. I will boycott this app if another example is added.. Aside from that. It's pretty good Functions well. Has some interesting documentaries and shows.
Loveing it
i love neflix but they have very little choices but now that they added avatar the last airbender i love it!
I really like it i just wish they didn't take off some movies and shows like the conjuring and crybaby ect. But yeah.
Netflix is great but netflix takes away some good movies/Shows.I wanted to watch a movie but it wasnt there anymore.
Good move
Interface looks cool
Great app

"Fantastic service. Never had any issues until recently. The last couple of days, programmes/movies won't load on my device. I'm using a OnePlus 6T, and it's been perfect until the last update. When I click on play, it just has a red circle with loading next to it. Tried switching WiFi to 4g, tried deleting and reinstalling the app, tried live chat yesterday, but it's not been resolved. I'm not going to pay for something I can't use, so sadly I think I'll have to remove my account completely."
Good but not excellent
Keep up the good work.
Loading is kinda slow but it great
It's good and all but I would like more anime like assassination classroom
Super
"Please, include English Dubs of animes like Death Note and Highschool DxD."

Very good but to does not finish and up to date with series. Thanks

The app is fine but when I watch shows the screen keeps staticing out with green and the animation stops moving but the dialogue keeps going on. It also resets things that I've watched when I'm not even finished the series
Good stuff
I like Netflix but not all movie's are there and I can't download movie also I don't know why

Good

The last update removed the mini player that et you watch while using other apps. Edit: it is now back. Review restored
"I love it but a good suggestion would be if there was an update that lets you minimize the screen so that you can have a ""floating screen"" and be able to see content while doing other things on your device."
Not bad
I like the app. Its just that its too expensive for a person like me. I dont watch Netflix eveyday.
Love this app

"very entertaing movies and shows i would like if you could to keep old movies and shows on netflix, like how you added shark boy and lava girl back you should add all of the tinker bell movies"
I hope more turkish and arabic movies
Amazing
I'm an older user of Netflix and I hope that Netflix developers team consider adding some new functionalities to Netflix app or account for a better user experience. 1. At profile level user must be able to select at least a primary and a secondary language for audio and subtitles. 2. Profiles for Kids at account level must be configurable by the parents for screen time limit per day I'll rate the app by 5 star if they add these functionalities.
Nice App..But why am i not able to access all shows ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•
"App is great but. Movie ""Cuties"" must be removed. It is sick, sick, sick."
The best experience everrrrr!!!
This was the first Entertainment app I download it I've never had a problem and I enjoy the lineup always something to watch I do have one request though it would be nice if you would show some of the older Agatha Christie movies with Peter Ustinov one of the most talented English actor I have come acrossðŸ’–âœ¨ðŸ’–âœ¨ðŸ’âœ¨

Quality entertainment.
Fantastic
"Pretty good app, doesn't slow down like online sites, however there are certain movies that I can't watch since apparently they're restricted because of my area, also it's a bit frustrating since some are the first movie to a second one and I can't watch them in order. In addition to this, I've already gone through almost all of the horror movies so it gets boring after a while. Otherwise cool."
Good
Gud experience
Have nice experience Good quality graphics thats nice
Good
it's great but it takes to much of my mobile data
So far Netflix is my favourite app. I enjoy the shows. Awesome.
Absolutely a boerdum buster
Good.
Its a good app but some movies thay i really want to watch are not avalabile in my region
Overall great app. But why can't I simply touch to hide the playback controls? Please fix this. I always have to adjust the brightness in order to hide the controls.
"Need better movies, equalizer, sicario etc..."
Honestly It's Not That Bad At All. But If It Had More Movies I Would Give It A 5 Star Rating But I Like Aaranormal Activity! Good Work Netflix
Love to binge watch netflix originals and documentaries. Wish they added new things more often.
Good app but sometimes the quality get very bad
needs more movies but LOVEEEE it
"Eu sÃ³ nÃ£o dou mais uma estrela por demorarem pra liberar as temporadas das sÃ©ries como, Julie and the phantoms minha ansiedade ta acabando comigo"
"Why on earth would you cancel a show that is hilarious, and brings the viewer back for more? I must say, I love your app and how it operates, however, I'm very disappointed that you(Netflix) canceled The Santa Clarita Diet. Your selection is not large enough to just throw away a good thing. But it is just my opinion."
Only drawback is so far I don't think there's a way to store downloaded episodes to my sd card on my phone. I have limited storage on it
Netflix would be better if you could put in all the beyblade burst in like the new one beyblade burst rise and can you also put back in the metal fusion please and thank you
"Mostly good catalog, a nice alphabetical list of available movies would be appreciated."
"Love the app, but the recent update I have to access the app, whats happening"
Great
really good love all the things to watch only bad thing is that npt many things hwo up lilke shows and stuff but its really good
I like this app but one of your shows monkart it has a bug once you fix the bug I'll rate this a 5 out of 5
Works Fine
Very good but needed more updated movies always like Series
Works good most time but on weekend and since covid been slower to find stuff to watch may be our slow internet also
Need to put more really good anime
I'm enjoying this app. I would have given 5 stars but I think people should be notified when you're about to remove a program...I was watching a series 1day came back the next day to pick up where I left off and it was gone..no warning or anything to say it was being removed. Thanks
"It's a really good app I dont have any problems the only thing i would say is, you could add more anime such as danganronpa or another and some more comedies."
Very good app
Easy to use.
I love the app Netflix! ã€ŠU3Uã€‹
In my opinion there should be a star rating for every movie within the app. It will help others who wish to watch any movies by seeing the rating score.
Please open the other payment channels like Google pay and Paytm.. it's so hard to pay if you don't have a credit card and your debit card is rupay.. please do something .. many of us are out of the service because we don't have other payment options..
Great just running out of choices for tweens
"Very entertaining, but more marvel/Action movies will only change this to 5 starsðŸ‘ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ"
Its very good and good quality
The app is not opening even though i have purchased
I love Netflix but there's not many options if you dont like corny movies or series.
Nice
Bas video streaming system la do bas bahot data consume kar leta hai bas yahi problem hai baki sab mst hai.
GREAT
The option to download is nice. Pretty good movies. Why did y'all take off Public Enemies?! ðŸ˜­
Good
Has some good movies not on tv. Found a tv series I really am enjoying. Did not know about.
Always Streaming. Thanks ðŸ‘
Could use some more animes in the uk like on piece
It's good full of entertainment

"Much better than windows version, but could be improved a but to be as good as the TV version"
It's the best app
Would like more shows to be added though but really good
very good.

"You do not have the movie ""DUNE"" that is why 4 stars."
cool .. .......... .. . . .. . ...
Its very nice but not 5 stars cause it will take down season 3 of victorius and it does not have a lot of the shows like kung fu panda 3 and other things
Good
Entertaining during lockdown
Enjoy & nice collection but rupay card not accpetable. I have requested online banking programs
Up to now the service is great. Lots of everything to watch.
Great but too much autoplay
"Very functional and full of good content , some months are a little bit more boring but most of time you can find good movies or series to watch."
Very great app really good content just love Netflix and chilling.

"After the last update I cannot continue watching Breaking Bad on phone, because I can't find it. Not in Search, not in Continue watching. And on my laptop it works. Otherwise the app and the service is great, entertaining."
cool
Noice
Good
Why I can't able to subcribe
It is incredible I could have gave 5 stars but only one season comes out every year maybe you can speed that up a bit and this app would be the only one that I use on my phone. Just outstanding WOW
ultimate appðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
Indian regional wanted
"Hey netflix, can u guys add a feature in your app. Where we can slide up and down on screen for increase or decrease of brightness and volume. Just like in mx player. They are providing this for ages. Why can't you?"
Good service. Selection is getting a bit stale but still some good new releases
it was awesome
Terrific
"It's solid, but it's netlfix on your phone, it isn't perfect or ideal but it is better than I would've guessed"
"Great movie and show streaming app, could use new movies and shows more often, other then that, great"
I will give a five if you update app so people can write written reviews in app
good
Nice
good but it needs more movies
Problems with loading page
Really good i like it but i wish you guys wont take any movies and other shows away cause i wanna watch everything that i watch already cause it brings me memories when i watch it again so pls update it before sep 30 pls thank you

Saran agar ada pilihan subtitle bahasa indonesiaðŸ™
I like it
Really good
Exceptional app implementation but issue is Why doesn't this app go full screen for Punch hole displays. It ruins the movie experience for phones with hole display cameras . Thus cutting out a part of screen which bothers ir mind all the time. Hope netflix team looks into that

It would be 5 stars but whenever I try to download a new episode it keep telling me that I have too many episodes when I haven't even downloaded any
Nice but need more....content ðŸ˜‹
This app gives the very high quality content.
V. Good.
Good feeling run smoother it is worth to buy plans but I reduced 1 star due to there is some movies lacking full screen mode and add IMDB rating to every movies and subtitle moving design is irritate to me
Hope to have latest movies
Very useful for all mobile users
Good
It's good but streaming is a bit expensive
Bring back edit text options on text field

Good but add more anime like naruto bleach demon slayer and one punch man season 2 and also the region differences are soo bad in the UK you cant get Spiderman but in the USA you can and that's the same for most countries
Ohkk

Very good Netflix
It's awesome but there is some movies that aren't in there
Its nice- but not really that updated ðŸ˜‡ also there isnt any yaoi/BL in neflix?...overall its good
A great watch but sometimes a show is there one minute but gone the next day
ðŸ™‚
Good
Great.
Netfix is good but can u pls had more Seasons on shows like haikyuu pls bc i dont understand why u cant
Beautiful
Its a very good App But the only thing I don't like about it is they are always getting rid of my favorite TV shows for the ones don't like
I like netflix but I want more anime and anime profiles
I love the app it has good quality and subtitles but I dislike it for some of the movies are showing a little blur any way its is a good app
"nice app lots of choices but the onky thing that bothers me is that they should add all the seasons of the animes cause i cant find anything else to watch my anime on and it pAiNs me that i dont know what happens next cause its a ""cliffhanger"""
At least we can watch movies
This is an amazing app
Excellent user experience. Content is average.
This app is wow
It is the best for series and movie trailers
It keeps starting over on the episodes that I have already completed
I love it but I wish lucky star was on here then I would of gave it five stars you know how ANIME lovers are
This app is just amazing but i rate it 4 out of 5 review only because they got rid of my favourite show the vampire diaries
i like it but i dont normaly use it
"I like it, but it would be better if the categories were more organized. Sometimes I find action movies in comedy or comedy in fantasy etx"
WAS LVL.4 STAR MEAN IS IT GOOD OR GREAT OR EXCELLENT!!ðŸ¤”
Cool
Overall experience is good... Please add 5 sec video skip instead of 10 sec... It is annoying...
Amazing app when your bored
Am so addicted to action movies
Add Manmarziyaan Movie please and Harry Potter series
Four out of five because there is no more Vampire Knight and nobody else is going to make any more Netflix should be making more I hope TV shows people like like I like the Vampire Knight
Best
The new app design is ridiculous. Why would you change a perfectly working app?
"Can you please put jojo bizarre adventure: diamond is unbreakable, please?"
The continue watching is not really good in mu case. Sometimes it wont continue to where I watched it last. Please fix this thanks.
Its pretty good but it sometimes the screen freezes and the people are still talking and I miss big parts of my show and I'm just watching a frozen image of my show the rest is fine
Love it but where i live (south africa) it doesn't have all the shows and seasons and movies that America hasðŸ™„â˜¹ï¸ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜’
Nice
LOVE THE APP
Good
The movies are nice but it doesn't have all movies. I think there should be more movies
Love it but needs new content
Get back Super Bad
Good
Why is legacies not available in indian Netflix .I subscribed it to watch legacies . Both Tvd nd the originals are available .but y not the legacies .
Very efficient
Ud
To be honest I would love to keep this app and not switch to hulu but there's shows that I really want to watch more of or just watch it like my hero academia and more of fairytail and a lot more but netflix has none of those witch is making think about moving to hulu
I think u should add dragon ball z and dragon bal super
Amazing app
I love the app. It has so many recommendations. I give it a 4 star because when you need to update it it wont let you in at all so make sure you're on top of updates. Other than that it's a great app
I love this app but one thing is that it's don't work on my old phone do I have to figure it out?
"App is amazing. Would be perfect if they update to make the Picture in Picture work with the newer gestures navigation. Works if I switch back to 3 buttons, but I like the gestures better. PinP works with Duo and Maps so I don't know why it doesn't for Netflix."
I like this app a lot. But one major feature of watching videos at higher or lower speed is missing
Good time pass
Great content but expensive for Indian people
I really like this app when watching movies but when you enter you need to pay but thanks to happy mod ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
Good day
Pls update more movies
Please add a new trailer button next to the series or movie info this would be great
It would be great if this app will be available using split screen. Please hear this matter
This app is great but my only problem is that you guys have all of total drama but not total drama world tour I don't get why?
"Netflix, please add more japanese anime, and anime icons for profiles. Thank you, I would literally appreciate it if you do."
"Hi I'm new here, so far I don't encounter anything bad but I just wanna suggest if you could make a comment section on every videos so that users can interact with each other on the said episode. Thanks a lot in advance"
please update awal
i like it cause i can see the movie i want
Idk what to tell about it
"Feature request: an option to automatically ""Skip intro on Android device"" would be awesome."
I love this app very much. No disappointments. I have a request that can you add the serial kaisi yeh yaariyaan. If you did I will be very grateful.
"I use it a lot, it has something for everyone. But it does recommend things I have absolutely no interest in."
Cool
Good
"It's great... But I wish they could put other movies or series ...especially frozen 1&2... But other than that, it's really a great app for watchingâ™¥"
"Good app, gets expensive though."
it is slow but other wise it is an awsome app
Good but they always cancel the best shows!
"All the shows are wonderful! I would like more interactives, but thats the only thing stopping me from giving the netflix community a fkve star rating!"
Since it has horror movies i give a 4 star rating
Okay
Very good app... but I think it's the time for Netflix light theme.. it will be very good feature
I love netflix its really good but lately its been a bit laggy for me
"Great, but need more informative series & documentaries like ""Connected"""
sometimes it is laggy and kicks me off
Great
Nice
"Downloads section UI and UX is not good, previous one was nice and simple"
great movies
Gud but does not bring movie's u search up for
Great
I really injoy netflix... It has all brandnew movies and drama S.O.L to NetfliX
Good
"Ever since the last update I haven't been able to connect the app to my TV through google chrome cast, but all my other apps are doing just fine...I would really like to get this fixed, please! ðŸ˜Ÿ"
Great!
Entertainment
Good
Yeah good
Good
Love netflix. Unable to watch on mobile as new settings force a dark screen. Been like this for months and Samsung or Netflix are doing nothing about it. Pity as it forces me to use other streaming apps on mobile now
it's ok ðŸ˜
Love it amazing place to watch tons of ahow but there are some they dont have.but still a good place to watch shows.
Movie collection is not that great. Amazon prime has a better movie list. But in house movies & shows are way far ahead than any other platform.
Make a signout button easy to access.
Some good movies are not here still
great movies but you lont one star because there is not new movies
Works my only complaint is that don't always pick back up where u left off
A good app
mehh
"I love it. They're missing of course a lot of movies, I just wish the could add Fantastic beasts 2 the crimes of grindelwald."
Good all-rounda but does need newer material.
Always something to watch. Just wish it didn't take so long to watch the next series.
The play button doesn't work after pausing in the new update. Please fix it ASAP.
Pro app
I love it but it would be better to have more scary movies
Sometimes when I search for TV shows or movies it gives me the opposite
Make Wallace and gromit account pics then I'll give it a five star
I like it A LOT!! but it would be good if thay added more One Piece episodes and the promised Neverland episodes
subs cc ccc
Love this app
Its not cheap but its amazing app
I love Netflix olot but I was wondering when would the put season 2 of attack on titan on
Heart
I love all the different shows and movies
This app is very good just add more films and movies for kids and teenagers and more season and please do a sequel to white fang
Not getting the cast option even when the chromecast and my mobile are linked by same wifi. Please rectify that. Please dont suggest me mobile casting. I would like to know why cast option is not visible to me on my netflix account. Rest is good.
Nice app
Overall satisfied
Its really good. But I think Netflix should work on more subscription plans for higher flexibility for Indian Audience.
Best...but subscription charges are very very high.. every one can't effort it..
"Its take a lot of time to release series like lucifer, flash ,iron fist"
I'm giving it a four star only because I don't know if it's my connection or if it's the app but it does buffer and freezes up a lot. I will update my review once I have WiFi and can give a better review. Other than my current issues the app is a nice app to have when watching your shows away from home.
Needs update. Nice app but It keeps saying Netflix not working-9
Good
Good but the search engine leaves a lot to be desired.
Why does my app close when i try to sighn in to my account?
Works well
Very much satisfied
Great
"Finally, theres SPEED function for the playback !!!! But you haven't make it available yet for PS4. I'm not sure about smart tv. But please add the function in PS4 !! Will change the rating to 5stars once updated. Thanks !!"
"Some anime are missing, please bring them"
"I love watching netflix because am a fan of korean series and most of my favorites are there and i can watch them all over and over again. But sad to say am a fan of marvels too but most of the mcu movies are not available in netflix but the rest, i love it.ðŸ’•"
"Overall I like it, but I don't like that if I want to watch any episode or any series again, there is no ""start over"" button or option. It starts where you left even if only few seconds are left."
Only thing is that it take too slow to come out with seasons thats all otherwise is good
The app loads fast and it's user friendly
Some times it doesn't work
Good
Nice
Worth It !
Has alot of great shows but sometimes alot of movies are lacking.
Great
"Suka error, ga bisa edit cahaya, harus uninstall dulu"
"Good, but still could improve more better."

Easy to download song effects super
"Love the app simple to use and stable, only one issue so far but started to be a bit annoying, the player doesn't resume from where I stopped watching, hopedully this gets resolved soon."
it's great so far. but it would be nice if we can create a folder so we can organize our list. it's kinda hard to find what i was watching/wanted to watch in my list since it's all jumbled.
"Quite a good experience. Quality shows, refreshing entertainment."
It's good. But I wish I could find more Turkish movies.
Nice
Netflix is so amazing if you do not have this app you should get it ðŸ‘
I Love this App!
It good
Wala pa hehe
I get to watch movies and my favorite one is naruto (edit) so since I watched so many shows the only problem I have is that I hate when you have to pay like monthly like why why not just be free or something I mean I guess but it's so annoying cause your gotta pay just to watch thos best shows anime and stuff but all I gotta say it just sucks
So nice it is so fast
Love it!!

Very entertaining I love how easy it is to work and sometimes gives you a bit of trouble when you can't find the movie you would like when it was already on there but other than that it's a great app
I wish there was an easier way to change to the next episode if you dont let it get to the last 30 sec then it doesnt let you iritates me
Best app ever made

"Â¿CuÃ¡ndo arreglarÃ¡n los errores que tiene esta app? AÃºn tiene demasiados errores, cuando intento ver una pelÃ­cula o una serie, me bota, diciendo ""Ha ocurrido un error con Netflix, intenta mÃ¡s tarde, si el error persiste, entra a la pÃ¡gina web"". Y no solo me bota de la serie, me bota de la aplicaciÃ³n, que asco das Netflix, has empeorado, nos haces perder el tiempo."

"Thank you Amazon for finally straight up ripping off Netflix's interface! HBO is getting there, but really every streaming platform needs to copy this model.

This app is great. There are two things that I would like to suggest which will improve upon watching experience. 1. Add a long press to mark episode or movie as played. There was a tv show which I watched season 1 from some place else but watched season 2 on Netflix. It show season 1 episode in my continue to watch tab. 2. Automatically remove movies and tv shows from the watch list when finished. I hope some reads this. Mostly feedbacks are ignored when a company gets this size.

"Audio language is very limited. There's tons of shows and movies that have the options for Spanish,France,Dutch,but yet netfilx doesn't have any of those auido languages. Like the ""Avatar:The last airbender,"" ""Cloudy with a chance of meatballs,"" ""Despicable me,"" and ""Turbo."" When this issue is solved I'll comeback to it,but for now I'll stick with Disney plus since it actually provides those options for my family and I."
